Which wires and which connector pins do I use?<BR><BR>A:    To create a hardware flow control capable cable for Mac-to-Newton or Newton-to-Newton communications (also called a "null-modem" cable) all you need are two mini-din-8 connectors and seven wires connected as follows:<BR><BR><CODE><PRE>Ground (4) -&gt; Ground (4)  (also connect to connectors' shrouds)Transmit+ (6) -&gt; Receive+ (8)Transmit- (3) -&gt; Receive- (5)Receive+ (8) -&gt; Transmit+ (6)Receive- (5) -&gt; Transmit- (3)Data Term Ready (1) -&gt; Clear To Send (2)Clear To Send (2) -&gt; Data Term Ready (1)</PRE><BR></CODE><BR>    You should use twisted pairs for 6/3, 8/5, and 1/2, to improve signal quality and reduce attenuation, especially in long cables.  You can use side-by-side pairs, as in telephone hookup cable, for short cable runs.<BR><BR>    Remember that because RS-422 uses a differential signal for transmit and receive, you always need two transmit and two receive pairs, and a break of either wire will cause communications in that direction to fail.  The advantage, however, is significantly longer and more reliable cable runs than RS-232.<BR><BR>    If you don't use hardware flow control, you can eliminate the 1/2 pair, but that's not recommended unless you know this cable will be used only in software flow control situations.<BR><BR>Q:    What's the pin mapping on the Newton-to-PC (DIN-to-DB9) cable?<BR><BR>A:    Here it is:<BR><BR>    Note that the pin numbers shown are as defined above.<BR><BR><CODE><PRE>PC (DB9)    Newton (DIN)    ========================1           1    2           3    3           5    4           7,2    5           4,8    6           1    7           N/C    8           N/C    9           N/C    N/C=not connected.</CODE></PRE></DL>
