Notes for PCMCIA DDK"FilesInBuild" has been modified from the generic one that MPW generateswhen you select "Create New Project…" from the NCT menu.  If you create anew project, you will need to make the following changes to the defaultFilesInBuild in order to build the project.The next three changes are needed for the PCMCIA DDK.* add "-d hasPCMCIA " to the build options at the top of the file thatbegin with the following (note, a space before the final quote is needed).This switch is needed by the headers.	 LocalARMCppOptions	 LocalCfronttOptions	 LocalCfrontCOptions 	LocalCOptions* change LocalLinkOptions toLocalLinkOptions="-rel "This allows the package loader to relocate the code when loaded into theNewton device. Note however, that if you are using the -AutoCopy option tomaintain a protocol in RAM, then your protocol code will be relocatedincorrectly and you need to use the 'old' method of taking the address of afunction or constant data object.* add the following lines to the list of include directories:-i  "{DDK_Libraries-dir}"-ic "{DDK_Includes-dir}PCMCIA"The following two changes are needed because of the way PCMCIA uses theprotocols declared in SerialChip.h.  This header effectively needs to befed through the compiler so its methods are available at link time.* change the -srcdirs line after the include directories to this:-srcdirs ': "{DDK_Includes-dir}HAL:"'* add these lines to the list of sources for your code files-clike "{DDK_Includes-dir}HAL:SerialChip.h""{DDK_Libraries-dir}DebugMacros.cp.o"Check out the enclosed sample code for an example of how these changesshould be applied to the'FilesInBuild' file.2/11/98Apple Computer, Inc.
