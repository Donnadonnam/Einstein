Is there a way to do this?<BR><BR>A:    Yes, there is a <CODE>clParagraphView</CODE> method called <CODE>caretRelativeToVisibleRect</CODE> that you can use.<BR><BR>    This method takes the global coordinates of the visible region of the paragraph view as an argument.  It returns either <CODE>'inbox,</CODE> <CODE>'top</CODE>, <CODE>'left</CODE>, <CODE>'bottom</CODE>, <CODE>'right</CODE>, or <CODE>nil</CODE>.
