If you attempt to create a soup with a longer name, the OS will create a soup with only the first 39 characters of the longer name.  We recommend you avoid this truncation, because typically the truncation removes some or all of your registered signature, and the resulting name will not be guaranteed unique.<BR><BR>    You can still provide longer/prettier names for users, by using the <CODE>soupDef</CODE> mechanism and putting the long name (typically without appended signature) in the <CODE>'userName</CODE> slot of that data structure.</DL>
