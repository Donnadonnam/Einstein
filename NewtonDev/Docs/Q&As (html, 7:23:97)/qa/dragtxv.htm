When I drag the view, the <CODE>protoTXView</CODE>-based view still draws its contents at the original coordinates. What is going wrong? <BR><BR>A:    The <CODE>protoTXView</CODE> prototype does not correctly update its draw origin coordinates when moved. To work around this bug, you must close the <CODE>protoTXView</CODE>-based view and re-open it. <BR><BR>    Before closing the <CODE>protoTXView</CODE>-based view, you will need to externalize the data so that you can restore the data when you reopen the view.  To do this, call the <CODE>Externalize</CODE> method and store the return value somewhere (perhaps in the parent of the <CODE>protoTXView</CODE>).  When you reopen the view, call the <CODE>Internalize</CODE> method with the stored return value of the call to <CODE>Externalize</CODE>.<BR><BR>    You will probably also want to save and restore the scroll coordinate, the caret offset, and the hilite range.</DL>
