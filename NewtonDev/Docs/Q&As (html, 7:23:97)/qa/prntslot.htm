All viewDefs should be designed so that they do not rely on your application being open or rely on state-specific information in your application. The application may be closed, or the user may continue to work in your application while the print/fax transport is imaging.<BR><BR>    Print format does have access to the <CODE>target</CODE> variable (it will contain the "body" of the data sent;  don't use <CODE>fields</CODE>.body). Note that if mulitiple items are sent, the value of <CODE>target</CODE> will change as the print format iterates over the list. Try to put the real "data" for the routing in the target using the view method <CODE>GetTargetInfo</CODE>.<BR><BR>    If, for some reason, you need to access slots from your application, you can access them using <CODE>GetRoot().(yourAppSymbol).theSlot</CODE>.<BR></DL>
