How do I do this?<BR><BR>A:    Add an <CODE>overviewTargetClass</CODE> slot to your application (or any other layout that is a descendent of your <CODE>newtOverLayout</CODE>). Set this slot's value to be the symbol that represents your data class (for example, <CODE>'|myData:SIG|</CODE>), which must match the data class you use when registering your print format. The NewtApp overview will use <CODE>overviewTargetClass</CODE> instead of the default overview class (<CODE>'newtOverview</CODE>) supplied by <CODE>newtOverLayout</CODE>. <BR><BR>    You must still register your print format, but you must set its <CODE>usesCursors</CODE> slot to <CODE>true</CODE> indicating that it will use the value target as a multiple item target and it will iterate over it using <CODE>GetTargetCursor(target)</CODE>. For an example of a print format that can handle multiple items, see the MultiRoute DTS sample.<BR><BR>    For more information about the default overview class  (<CODE>'newtOverview</CODE>) , see the Q&amp;A "Limitations with NewtOverview Data Class".<BR><BR></DL>
