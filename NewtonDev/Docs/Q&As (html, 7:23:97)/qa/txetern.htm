How can I get text, styles, pictures, etc. out of the object returned by <CODE>protoTXView</CODE>'s <CODE>Externalize</CODE> method without either a) instantiating a <CODE>protoTXView</CODE> or b) digging in the data structure?<BR><BR>A:    You must instantiate a view to get data from the externalized object that <CODE>protoTXView</CODE> produces.  The data structures in that object are not documented or supported.  You may be tempted to do this anyway, since it looks as though the data structure is obvious.  Don't, it isn't.  <CODE>ProtoTXView</CODE> actually uses several different data formats depending on the complexity and storage destination for the data.<BR><BR>    It's actually very easy to instantiate a view based on <CODE>protoTXView</CODE> to get at the data.  Here's one way:<BR><CODE><PRE>    local textView := BuildContext(        {            _proto: protoTXView,            viewBounds: SetBounds(0, 0, 0, 0),            viewFlags: 0,            ReorientToScreen: ROM_DefRotateFunc,        });    textView:Open();    textView:Internalize(myExternalizedData);</PRE><BR>    </CODE>You can now use all the <CODE>protoTXView</CODE> APIs to get the data from the <CODE>textView</CODE> object.  Don't forget to clean up with <CODE>textView:Close()</CODE> when you're done.<BR></DL>
