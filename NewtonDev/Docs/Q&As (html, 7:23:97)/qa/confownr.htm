How can I keep confidential information from being sent?<BR><BR>A:    Every owner entry has an <CODE>owner</CODE> slot, the value of which is a frame.  This slot is removed from the entry before it is sent to another Newton device.  You can add slots to this frame to store them, but keep them from being sent.  Be sure to append your developer signature to any slot names you add to the <CODE>owner</CODE> frame.<BR><BR>    Note that this only applies to the built-in Beam transport; any other transport or application can access all the slots in the Owner entry.</DL>
