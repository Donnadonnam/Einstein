Sometimes the picker will be blank when I open it. What's happening?<BR><BR>A:    <CODE>ProtoPicker</CODE> does not correctly reset the <CODE>viewOriginY</CODE> slot if you  display a list that requires scrolling, and then display one that does not require scrolling. The solution is to manually reset the <CODE>viewOriginY</CODE> slot to 0 if you dynamically change the contents of the picker.</DL>
