There is no UI at all in DILette.DILette expects to run on a Macintosh and use the Modem Port for a serialconnection to a Newton device which is running the SoupDrink package.  Ifyou want to use a different port (or use ADSP or straight serial withoutMNP error correction), uncomment the appropriate lines in the source.DILette will connect to the Newton device and send a command to the NewtonSoupDrink application so that SoupDrink will respond with "Hello".  DILettethen closes the connection.  If DILette believes everything worked properly,it will beep twice and immediately exit.If any errors occur, a message will be printed in MacsBug. Press "g" and hitreturn to have the connection closed down properly, otherwise you'll probablyhave to reboot your Macintosh in order to use the serial port again.Note that the CSTR resource file must be linked in to every DIL application.It contains resources used internally by the CDIL to find the appropriateCommunications Toolbox files.Also note that the names of the serial ports ("Modem Port") etc will have tobe modified to use DILette on a non-English version of the Macintosh System.Modified April 1997 - converted to CodeWarrior 11. Note that DILette stilluses the old ANSI libraries, not the MSL ones which are the default onesfor CW11.  Why?  Because the MSL libraries don't by default include one for2-byte integers and 8-byte longs, which is what the Mac DILs use right now.If you build your own 2i8d MSL library, things should work fine too.
