When chosen from the "Tools" menu, this tool opens a slip with an input view.  You can write into this view and tap a button to insert the text into the currently displayed word processor document.The "HandWrite.lyt" file has the template for the slip that is opened.  The InsertText method of the textView child of that floater actually adds the text to the word processor document.To register and unregister a tool, use Newton Works methods RegNewtWorksTool and UnregNewtWorksTool. For safety, you must check for the existence of the Newton Works application before using these methods.Note that if a user closes Newton Works while your tool slip is open, the tool slip is not notified that Newton Works has been closed.  You must explicitly check to make sure that the view definition view is still open before modifying its contents. For instance, use the ViewIsOpen function using code like "call kViewIsOpenFunc with (...);"
