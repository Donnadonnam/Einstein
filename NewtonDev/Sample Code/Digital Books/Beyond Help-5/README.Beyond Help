Beyond Help, by Bob Ebert, mods by David FedorCopyright (c) 1993-1995, Apple Computer, Inc.  All rights reserved.This sample illustrates using the Newton BookMaker to create a custom helpfile (using the TinyTim reader in the Newton) and open it with anapplication.The help book source gives most of the information on using and creatinghelp books.  Read it!Note: there are two common pitfalls people have trouble with when creatinghelp books.  First, be sure to select the menu item "Help Size" inBookMaker.  Second, you must remove two lines from the BookMaker outputfile; see the release notes for details.
