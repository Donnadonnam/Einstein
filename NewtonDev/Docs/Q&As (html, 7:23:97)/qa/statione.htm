Why?<BR><BR>A:    There is a problem in the MessagePad 120 and 130 with Newton 2.0 OS constructing popups that contain icons. See the  "Picker List is Too Short " Q&amp;A in the Pickers, Popups and Overviews  section.</DL><A NAME="Dynamically_Changing_the_Height_of_Stationery"><H3><HR><B> </B>Dynamically Changing the Height of Stationery  (11/19/96)</A></H3><DL><DD>Q:    How can I dynamically change the height of my roll-style stationery?<BR><BR>A:    To dynamically change the height of roll-style stationery you will need to change the target's <CODE>height</CODE> slot, flush the data, and then do a re-target.  For instance, you might have the following method in your stationery:<BR><BR>    <CODE><PRE>    DoResize: func( newHeight )    begin        target.height := newHeight;        :FlushData();        :DoRetarget();</PRE><BR>       end;</CODE><BR></DL><A NAME="Properly_Registering_a_ViewDef"><H3><HR><B> </B>Properly Registering a ViewDef  (1/3/97)</A></H3><DL><DD>Q:    When I add a viewDef using <CODE>RegisterViewDef</CODE> on Newton 2.0 OS, I get the "grip of death" alert ("The package  'MyApp' still needs the card you removed...") when the card the viewDef is on is removed.  I don't get the grip of death alert when using Newton 2.1 OS.  How can I keep the grip of death alert from appearing?<BR><BR>A:    In Newton 2.0 OS, you must <CODE>EnsureInternal</CODE> the second argument to the <CODE>RegisterViewDef</CODE> global function.  The <CODE>RegisterViewDef</CODE> global function was changed in Newton 2.1 OS to automatically <CODE>EnsureInternal</CODE> the second argument. <BR><BR>    Note: <CODE>EnsureInternal</CODE>-ing something that has been <CODE>EnsureInternal</CODE>-ed is a very fast operation so you don't need to worry about checking which platform you are running on.</DL>
