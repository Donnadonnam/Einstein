If I want to "untie" two views that have been tied with <CODE>TieViews</CODE>, do I simply remove the appropriate slots from the <CODE>viewTie</CODE> array?<BR><BR>A:    The tied view's method will be executed as a result of the same actions that cause the main view's <CODE>viewChangedScript</CODE> to be called.  This can happen without calling <CODE>SetValue</CODE>, for example, when the user writes into a view that has recognition enabled, the <CODE>viewChangedScript</CODE> will get called.<BR><BR>    As of Newton 2.1 OS, there is no API for untying tied views.  It may be wise to first check for the existance of an <CODE>UntieViews</CODE> function, and call it if it exists, but if it does not, removing the pair of elements from the tied view's <CODE>viewTie</CODE> array is fine.</DL>
