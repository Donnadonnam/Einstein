This sample code has been provided "AS IS" and the**      responsibility for its operation is 100% yours.  You are not**      permitted to modify and redistribute the source as "DTS Sample Code."**      If you are going to re-distribute the source, we require that you**      make it clear in the source that the code was descended from**      Apple-provided sample code, but that you've made changes.*/This sample gives you a replacement for the Newton OS 2.0 ROM protoNumberPicker.It has more functionality than the built-in ROM proto. We recommend that you use this proto wherever you would normally use protoNumberPicker.NOTE: there are a number of constants defined for protoNumberPicker_TDS. Instead of including these in a text file they are defined in the beforeScript of the protoNumberPicker. These constants are only used in the implementation ofprotoNumberPicker_TDS, they are not required to use the API.DOCUMENTATION-------------We kept the basic API the same as the builtin protoNumberPicker.Slots-----maxValue	An integer that is the maximum value for the picker. Must be no greater 	than 100000000. Once the picker is displayed, you may change the value of 	maxValue using SetValue.minValue	An integer that is the minimum value for the picker. Must be no smaller 	than -100000000. Once the picker is displayed, you may change the value of	minValue using SetValue.value	The current value displayed by the picker. This is an integer number in the	range 100000000 to -100000000.  Once the picker is displayed, you may 	change the value using SetValue.showLeadingZeros	Controls the display of leading zeros. Set to TRUE to show leading zeros, 	or NIL to hide them. Once the picker is displayed, you may change the value 	of showLeadingZeros using SetValue.showSign	Controls the display of the +/- sign in front of the number. Set to TRUE to	display the sign, NIL to hide it. Once the picker is displayed, you may	change the value of showSign using SetValue.viewBounds	Must be set to a value that is large enough to display all the digits and 	the +/- sign if you set showSign to TRUE.	The height of the view must be 28 pixels. The width is 23 pixels per digit	plus 16 pixels if you display the +/- sign.
