(Your RemoveScript will be called in both situations).DeletionScripts are not called by the Newton 1.x Operating System.In this sample, the InstallScript, RemoveScript, and DeletionScript all printmessages to the inspector saying that they are running.The method to put a DeletionScript in a form part (ie. a normal application)is the same as for an auto part.  The InstallScript for an auto part, however,takes an additional parameter, the removeFrame.  Just change the project typeand edit the second parameter to InstallScript in Special Scripts.t as necessary.-David Fedor, Jim Schram
