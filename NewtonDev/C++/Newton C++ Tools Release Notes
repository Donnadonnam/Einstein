Newton C++ Tools 1.0 Read MeKnown limitations1) You need to create an alias to the Newtsbug application and place it in the folder named …:NCT_Folder:Tools: which is inside the MPWforNCT folder or your own MPW folder, so the menu item "Launch Newtsbug..." will work. 2) Newtsbug doesn't properly handle package names/ID's (set via NTK's "Package Settings") that contain the π (option-p) character so although you can name NTK project file with the project.π, you must go into the "Package Settings" menu item and remove it from the strings in those dialogs.  Thus the "package name" in the file will not match the filename. An alternative is to use a filename suffix (.proj), or something similar, instead of π.3) The CLibrary function, mktime(), handles carrying to higher units differently than the Macintosh and MetroWerks version of this function, so IF the input parameters contain values outside the normal range for hours/day/month, etc, the result may be different.4) The interface file, NewtonMemory.h, #defines an identifier DEFAULT_NIL. DEFAULT_NIL is  ONLY for use in function declarations to allow default parameter value declarations in C++.  DEFAULT_NIL should never be used as a parameter in your calls to any functions.
