Why?<BR><BR>A:    On PowerPC MacOS computers only, there is a bug in 1.6 and 1.6.2 wherein building store parts will cause this behavior.  The workaround is building the store part on a 680x0-based MacOS computer.<BR><BR>    If you don't have a 680x0 machine available, you might try any of various third-party applications which remove the PowerPC-native code from an application which contains 680x0 code and PowerPC code, thus forcing it to run the 680x0 code instead.  Before doing this, be sure to backup your copy of NTK!</DL>
