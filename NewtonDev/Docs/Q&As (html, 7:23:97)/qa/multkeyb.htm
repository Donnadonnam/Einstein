When my keyboard opens, it seems like any other  keyboard closes. How do I keep multiple keyboards open?<BR><BR>A:    When a <CODE>protoKeyboard</CODE>-based view opens, it closes the last-opened <CODE>protoKeyboard</CODE>-based view. However, you need not use <CODE>protoKeyboard</CODE>. <BR><BR>    Instead, you can base your keyboard on a different view type (for instance, <CODE>protoDragger</CODE>) and use the <CODE>RegisterOpenKeyboard</CODE> view message to register the keyboard with the system. Using <CODE>RegisterOpenKeyboard</CODE> will ensure that the caret is set up properly and allows you to track the caret changes with the <CODE>viewCaretChangedScript</CODE> view message if desired.<BR></DL>
