BookSample, a Newton Bookmaker example source.  by Bob EbertCopyright (c) 1993-1995 Apple Computer, Inc.  All rights reserved.This sample illustrates how to make a book using the Newton Book Maker. It's fairly straightforward and, even, self documenting.  (The chosen bookis the Newton Bookmaker user's manual.)The book source was originally written in Microsoft Word, because I like thestyles support they have.  Unfortunately, a MS Word converter for the ClarisXTND system may not be available to everyone, so a MacWrite II version ofthe book source has been included.  The MacWrite version was created byopening the MS Word version in MacWrite II, then saving it.  I neveractually tested building a book from the MacWrite source... but it shouldwork just fine.Some caveats on building books with MS Word:   Turn off the "Quick Save" option in Word.  Having this option on seems to   allow Word to put little pieces of garbage in between paragraphs which   confuse the book maker.  If you start seeing odd style changes in your   resulting books, it's probably because of this.      If you do start getting odd style changes, one thing that worked for me   was to save the source document as RTF text, then re-import it into Word   as a new document and re-save it.      Also, beware that, when changing styles in Word, the final (invisible)   paragraph mark can sometimes be in a different font or point size from   the rest of the paragraph.  This also confuses the Newton Book Maker.      In general, best results are achieved when you start with unstyled text,   then add font, size, and style information only where needed.   Some Newton Book Maker caveats:   Only the fonts New York and Geneva are supported.  Any other font you use   in your source book will show up in the Newton as the System Font (Which   is Espy Sans)  It's probably a good idea to avoid using this font (since   it doesn't print well), so it's worth the effort to weed out any font   besides New York and Geneva from your source book.     Comment dot commands (.#) appear to be limited to 256 characters.  Text   beyond the 256th character is treated as a .story.  You can put multiple   .# comments on multiple lines to work around this.      Watch out for backslashes, dot commands you want in content, etc.  Keep   in mind that the output from the Newton Book Maker is run thorugh NTK,   which also gets a stab at interpreting escape characters etc.      Don't try to put escaped unicode characters (i.e. /u2022/u) in your book   source.  It may appear to work, but style runs will get messed up as the   Book Maker treats the above as 8 characters, even though only 1 is   produced.  [A later version of Book Maker may fix this.]   To build the book, drop the source document on the Newton Book Maker icon,then click the Do It button.  Save the result.  Add the .f file to a NTKproject.  (No layout needs to be present.)  Set the Package Name in the NTKProject Settings window.  Build the project.  Download it.NTK will close and re-open the .f file each time it builds, so once the filehas been added to an NTK project there is no need to re-add it.  Justreproduce the .f output with the Newton Book Maker, save the new result overthe old file (replacing it), and rebuild the project.Finally, the Newton Book Reader caches some information abouteach book it loads.  (The .isbn, .title, and .keywords among other things.) If you change any of these you will need to reset the Newton to get thechanges to take effect.Version 4 -- There two cases of .picture commands followed by a returncharacter and then a space *before* the picture. That was OK for Bookmakerversion 1.0.1 but it will not compile in Bookmaker 1.1. We just removed thespace characters preceding the pictures.Also removed all references to "Dickens" (another name for Newton Bookmaker)
