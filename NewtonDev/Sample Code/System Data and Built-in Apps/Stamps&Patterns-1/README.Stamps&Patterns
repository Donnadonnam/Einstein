Registered stamps show up when you tap the stamp picker. Registered patterns show up when you tap the pattern picker.Stamps can either be a bitmap or a PICT.  If you are registering bitmaps asstamps, you should include a mask so that the stamp looks correct when placedover a non-white background.Patterns can be created from a hex string in NTK or from a 'PAT ' resource inResEdit.  The drawing application currently supports three types of patterns:black and white, gray, and dithered.A black and white pattern is drawn with 1's equivalent to a black pixel, and0's equivalent to a white pixel.  Black and white patterns have a class of'pattern.A gray pattern can be as large as 8 pixels high by 8 pixels wide, with eachpixel represented by an RGB triplet contained within the binary object.  Eachcomponent of the triplet is a 16-bit value ranging from 0 to 65535.  Graypatterns have a class of 'graypattern.Dither patterns are black and white patterns where the black and white pixelsare re-mapped to shades of gray.  Compared to patterns of class 'graypattern,dither patterns are very space efficient; they only take up about twice theamount of memory that a regular black and white pattern takes up.  Ditherpatterns have a class of 'ditherPattern.Note that if you have a drawing document that uses some stamps added byStamps&Patterns and you remove the Stamps&Patterns package before the documenthas been saved, the draw application will start to behave very weirdly.  Thisis because the drawing application still holds onto a reference of the stamp inthe package.  Once the entry is saved, all stamp shapes are EnsureInternal'd.
