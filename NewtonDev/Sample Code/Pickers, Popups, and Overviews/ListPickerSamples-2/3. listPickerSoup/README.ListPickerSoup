The user cannot add or remove entries only select entries.Important---------As items are selected nameRefs are created and entered into the listPicker.selected array.  The nameRef will remain in the array even after they are unselected.  The way the nameRef's are remove is if you call a listPicker function such as getSelected().  This function will clean out any nameRefs that have been created but currently have their _unselected slot set to true.
