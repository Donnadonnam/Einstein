ReadMe:  QuickView InstallationAugust 29, 1996This document contains instructions on how to install the quick reference database for Newton Programmer's Reference.INSTALLINGSimply copy the Newton Prog Ref (QuickView) folder to your hard drive. This folder contains the QuickViewª application, a Help file, and the Newton Prog Ref.qv database.QuickView and the Newton Prog Ref.qv database are also set up so that you can run them off the CD without copying them to your hard drive if you wish.*Note* For the current version of QuickView, the QuickView application and any of its databases must reside in the same folder. If you are currently using QuickView for the Macintosh Programmer's Toolbox Assistant or other multiple-database titles, we don't recommend that you replace your current version of the QuickView application with the one on the CD. The QuickView application included on this CD has been tested only with the Newton Prog Ref.qv database, which is a single-database title.USING QUICKVIEWTo begin using QuickView, double click the QuickView application.For further information about using  QuickView and its databases, you can consult the QuickView Help file, accessed through the Help menu when QuickView is active. For this release, the Newton Programmer's Reference Help file is available. That Help file explains correctly how to use QuickView.FEEDBACKWe value your feedback on this and other Newton developer documentation.
