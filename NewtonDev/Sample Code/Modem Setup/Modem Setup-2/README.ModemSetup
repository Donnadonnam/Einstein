Modem Setup Installer 2.0By Jim Schram, Avi Weiss, Rob Ober, Scott LeahyCopyright (c) 1995 Apple Computer, Inc.  All rights reserved.This project allows you to build modem setups for use withthe 2.0 or later Newton operating system ONLY.  Modem setupscreated with this project can NOT be used on Newtons runningthe 1.x operating system.1)  Copy the entire project and rename the Project File appropriately.2)  Change the Package Name in Project Settings.3)  Edit the constants in Project Data for your modem & local language.4)  Recompile and download.The project is built as an auto part which installs a modem setupconfiguration into the system and then removes itself.Be certain to use an INTEGER value for the kVersion version number.  Thisis necessary because the installation script will compare the versionnumber of the modem setup being installed with the version alreadyinstalled (if any) and confirm the installation with the useraccordingly.
