 	****** Release Notes for Newton Book Maker 1.1 ******Table of Contents:	- Translators	- Changes from 1.0, 1.0.1	- Known problems and bugs in 1.1------------------------------------------------------------------		*** Translators ***- Book Maker 1.1 includes three translators: Plain Text, MacWrite II andMacWrite 5.0.  Most word processors support saving files in MacWrite IIformat.  Once a file has been thus saved, the included MacWrite IItranslator can be used.- Book Maker can take advantage of any XTND translators already installedon your system.-Although Book Maker will open a plain text file without XTND, it'srecommended that the Plain Text driver be used for text.  However, for bestBook Maker results, use a word processor.- A common problem that occurs when adding new translators is that they donot  appear available.  To resolve this, locate and remove the file 'XTNDTranslator List'.   Doing this tells XTND to rebuild it's list of availabletranslators.- Claris applications often include additional XTND translators, andDataViz also provides translators that can be used with Book Maker.Contact these companies directly as indicated below.	DataViz Inc.	55 Corporate Drive	Trumbull, CT   06611	AppleLink:  D0248	PH:  203-268-0030	FAX: 203-268-4345	Claris Corporation, Dept.

To use the book source in your project, simply remove these twolines:output.book := book;output.help := TRUE;
