How do I debug my endpoint code? <BR><BR>A:    If you are using a serial or MNP serial endpoint, you can use a serial PC Card to do your comms, freeing the standard serial port for the NTK Inspector. If you are using a serial or MNP serial endpoint, you must  also modify your endpoint's instantiate options to use a PCMCIA slot instead of the built-in serial port.  Here is the option you should add directly after the endpoint service option:<CODE><PRE>{    type:          'option,    label:          kCMOSerialHWChipLoc,    opCode:         opSetRequired,    form:           'template,    result:         nil,    data:           {        argList:  [kHWLocPCMCIASlot1, 0],       // or kHWLocPCMCIASlot2        typeList: ['struct, ['array, 'char, 4], 'uLong]      }</PRE><BR>    }</CODE><BR><BR>    If you are using Newton Internet Enabler (NIE) endpoints, you can use a PC Card Modem instead of a serial PC Card, but you do not have to add any special endpoint options. NIE will handle this automatically, provided you correctly set up your modem in the Modem preferences in the Prefs application.<BR><BR>    This should allow your endpoint code to use the PC Card (serial card or modem card) instead of the built-in serial port. Connect the NTK Inspector to the built-in serial port as you normally would.  If you are using an AppleTalk endpoint, you can simultaneously use the NTK inspector connected via AppleTalk.</DL>
