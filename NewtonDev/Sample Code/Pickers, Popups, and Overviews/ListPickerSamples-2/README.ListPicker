Developers are able to display data withlittle effort and code, due to listPickers automatic support of scrolling,sorting, azTabs, and folder tabs. ListPicker supports changing of data entries via a default editor that isspecific to the type of data in the field or a user defined editor that willautomatically be opened if any data is invalid, a new entry is added or userenvocation from a popup.The Samples-----------The 6 samples that are included are designed to help the developer becomefamiliar to the basic constructs of a listPicker.  The samples grow incomplexity. We recommend that you first look at them in the order listed below.The samples are:	ListPickerArray		simple array based listPicker	ListPickerPopUp		array based picker with a popup item in the list	ListPickerSoup			simple soup based listPicker	ListPickerNewEntry	soup based listPicker plus creating new entries	ListPickerChange		array based picker plus editable popup menu	ListPickerIcon			soup based listPicker plus display of iconsImportant Notes---------------The basic data type of entries for a listPicker is the 'nameRef and thepickerDef must of class nameRef.  When dealing with soup most operations are taken care of by the listPicker. ListPicker is made to display lists of data and is not intended to supportdouble tapping for editing existing data.  The use of a pickActionScript mayallow the use to provide editing when the user taps.When items are checked in the listPicker a nameRef is placed it the selectedarray.  This nameRef will remain in the selected array, even if the item isunselected until the getSelected method is caled to "clean up" the array.
