Always return true if the alarms   do not represent a feature which can be turned off.   PeriodicAlarm -- a function in your base view which will be called when   the alarm "goes off".      The actual storage of the 'alarms' is based on an "ownerSymbol" which is usedto register the alarms globally with the System Services component of the operating system. The protoPeriodicAlarmEditor is merely an editor for thesealarms which automatically creates "callback" functions for the alarmswhich resubmit themselves for their next occurance as soon as the alarm goes off.
