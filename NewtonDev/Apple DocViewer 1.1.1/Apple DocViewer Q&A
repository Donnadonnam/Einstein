Apple DocViewer Q&As1/13/94________This document contains the most commonly asked questions about the Apple DocViewer.________Apple DocViewer is a Macintosh application which allows a user to read documentation on the computer screen. Features of the application include full page view, “live” table of contents and book index, bookmarks and advanced searching capabilities. Many of Apple's technical development and product documentation is delivered in Apple DocViewer.________What is the history of Apple DocViewer?Apple DocViewer was designed originally to deliver Apple Developer Support books like Inside Macintosh to the Apple developer community. The product gained great support and developers have asked to use the Builder for their own documents. The software was developed at Apple, with the assistance of Bear River Associates consulting services.________How do I create my own Apple DocViewer documents?The software which creates Apple DocViewer documents is called “Builder”. The Builder software is available via site licensing only. Send an AppleLink to SW.LICENSE for the license agreement.(e-mail sw.license@applelink.apple.com)  For product info, your contact is AppleLink ADV or e-mail adv.applelink.apple.com.________What kind of support is available for the Builder?This product is sold as unsupported. A user’s guide and how to‘s are included with the product. A threaded discussion board is set up to exchange ideas and report bugs in the following path on AppleLink:    Developer Support      Developer Talk        Developer Press          Apple DocViewerCompanies who can help you (for a fee) are listed in the board.

How do I get my documents converted?There are several companies who are set up to perform the conversion for you. A complete list is available on AppleLink in the support path mentioned above. Additionally, if you elect to have your documents converted for you, you will not need a site license.________What if I want to distribute Apple DocViewer with my documents?A distribution agreement is available. Send an AppleLink to SW.LICENSE for the agreement form.________How much is the distribution agreement for Apple DocViewer?$2,500/year for up to 50,000 copies. $5,000/year for unlimited number of copies.________How does the Builder work?The Builder takes Microsoft Word or Frame FrameMaker files and converts them into Apple DocViewer files. The structure of the documents, table of contents and index entries are translated and automated in Apple DocViewer. Additionally, all words in the document become “keywords” via the build process, providing a very powerful search capability.________Does the Builder only support Word and FrameMaker files?No.  If the source program can export RTF, generally the Builder can generate a set of keywords for the searching (but no table of contents or book index). If the source cannot generate an RTF file, then you can still build an Apple DocViewer file, but the user will not be able to copy text or perform searching.________What is the current version of Apple DocViewer?1.1.1 for the viewer, b14 for the Builder.________What about upgrades?Upgrades are not included in the agreements. They will be made available, either free or for an upgrade fee, at time of release.________What does Apple DocViewer do with fonts?Apple DocViewer is font dependent and uses standard Macintosh font substitution should the end user not have the original fonts. It is suggested that you use standard System fonts for your documentation or deliver your custom fonts with your product.________What are plans for future versions?At this point in time we are unable to discuss unannounced products.
