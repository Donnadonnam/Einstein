It allows you to use and test the built-in comm tools.  The currently supported comm tools are: serial, modem, ADSP, IrDA, and NIE.Tool Time has a terminal mode which acts as an ASCII terminal emulator.  It also has a test mode which allows you to input and output a variety of data types using a variety of options.  It also has an Echo mode which prints incoming data to the screen before it echos it back to the sender.To use Tool Time, install the Tool Time.pkg package and the Standard Tools.pkg.Tool Time has not been thoroughly tested so please report any bugs, comments, or enhancement requests to devsupport@newton.apple.com.The NTJ article describing the Tool Time architecture does not reflect the architecture of Tool Time 1.1.  This version of tool time is a complete rewrite, and many changes have been made.  If you have questions about the architecture, feel free to contact Ryan Robertson at robertson@newton.apple.com.Enjoy!¥The PartsThe Tool Time code base is broken up into five different projects.  They are:Application - The Tool Time application code.  The application knows very little about Newton comm tools and comms scripting.Modules - Code for each of the comm tool modulesStream File - The Tool Time stream file.  This file is necessary for any other Tool Time parts.Test Monitor - Code showing how to register and deregister a Tool Time monitor.Tool Time Cleanup - Code to remove preferences from any version prior to 1.1.¥Things to do* Export protoToolManager and protoToolInstance as unit refs.* Document protoToolManager, protoToolInstance, and Tool Monitor APIs* Cleanup the objectPrinter code.  Remove call to StrHexDump and write my own routine that handles large binary objects.* Add ability to auto-connect N number of endpoints.* Should make the link floater smart enough that a user cannot link an endpoint with itself* Finish implementing Analyze mode* Break Standard Tools into two smaller packages.  One with unit exports that the other uses.¥Standard Tools Package ChangesChanges for 1.1d7* Added support for IrDA mux tool* Added tool monitor information* Began adding support for serial analyze mode* Added support for changing IrDA tool service nameChanges for 1.1d6* Added support for tool info template* Added NIE tool info templateChanges for 1.1d5* Fixed up EmergencyDisconnect codeChanges for 1.1d3		* Added support for tool prefs* Added NIE tool prefs* Added prefs to make NIE misbehaveChanges for 1.1d1* Fixed Modem connection* Added checkbox to disable info slip for serial and NIEChanges for 1.0b2* Brought the tools up to the the Tool Time 1.0b13 architecture.* Still need to implement serial endpoint extras¥Tool Time ChangesChanges for 1.1d5* Added some code for handling monitors* Added an analyzer mode, implemented some of the code to make it workChanges for 1.1d4* Added support for tool info* Added icons to options buttonChanges for 1.1d3* fixed up dynamic floater width* fixed up data input handling* fixed up notifyerrorChanges for 1.1d2* Added support for individual tool prefs panels* Worked around some txView weirdnessChanges for 1.1d1* Updated Info Slip handling* Keydown problems with terminal input lineChanges for 1.0b8* Control Key Passthrough* Changed autoscroll so it didn't go to half page	* Enhanced scrolling algoritmChanges for 1.0b7* Fixed the error reporting codeChanges for 1.0b6* Added support for profiling data rates* Fixed a bug in button bar handlingChanges for 1.0b5* Added support for twoStep toolsChanges for 1.0b4* Added TranslateError to tool modules API* Implemented Echo mode* Various Bug fixesChanges for 1.0b3* API enhancementsChanges for 1.0b2* Fixed up the AppleTalk connect slip so that you can enter a server name and zone through input lines.* Fixed the Appletalk listen so that it works.
