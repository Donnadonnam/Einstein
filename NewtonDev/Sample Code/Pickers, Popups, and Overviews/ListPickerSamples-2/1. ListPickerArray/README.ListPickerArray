The elements that are displayed in the listPicker are  entries in the listPicker.selected array.  This array is populated with nameRefs which is the required class of data for the listPicker.   The default setting for selection state is selected.   As the selected array is popluated the _unselected slot of the nameRef is set to true so that no items are selected.   To have one item preselected the _unselected slot is set to true for the one item.Important---------The items in the listPicker selected array must be a subclass of nameRef. For this sample, all of the items are of class nameRef (the default). This required for proper behavior of the listPicker functions.
