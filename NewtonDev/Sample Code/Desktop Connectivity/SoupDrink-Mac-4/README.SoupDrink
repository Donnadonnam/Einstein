It is designed to communicate with the SoupDrink-Newton package, whichis a separate sample code project.You can obtain the DIL libraries, headers and documentation from http://dev.info.apple.com/newton/tools/dils.htmlMost of the interesting DIL code can be found in the file Engine.c, which holdsthe cross-platform code which makes most of the DIL API calls.The routine SetupPortMenu() demonstrates how to dynamically find the names ofthe available ports - these can be different on different models of MacOScomputers, and change in localized versions of the MacOS System.The SoupDrink application has two test scripts.  The first, "Soup Drink", willread the entire contents of any soup on the Newton device.  It does this bysending a command to the Newton device indicating the name of the soup to read,and then repeatedly reading frames which are sent from the Newton application,converting them to text, and writing them to the file SoupData.out.The second test script, "Add New Name Card", constructs a name card frame forthe built-in Names application, and sends it to the Newton device.  The NewtonSoupDrink application adds it to the Names soup.Note that the CSTR resources found in the file SoupDrink.rsrc must be linked into every DIL application.  They are used internally by the CDIL to find theappropriate Communications Toolbox files.  These CSTR resources can also befound in the file CSTR.rsrc, which does not contain the SoupDrink-specificresources.NOTE: The "SPIT" command is supported for compatibility with older versions ofthis sample. If the SPIT command was sent instead of DRNK, a text version ofthe entry (NOT a frame) was sent. This was relevant only to a bug in someversions of Newton 1.x. See engine.c for more info.Modified April 1997 - cleaned up a few small bugs, and converted to CodeWarrior 11.Note that SoupDrink still uses the old ANSI libraries, not the MSL ones whichare the default ones for CW11.  Why?  Because the MSL libraries don't by defaultinclude one for 2-byte integers and 8-byte longs, which is what the Mac DILsuse right now.  If you build your own 2i8d MSL library, things should work finetoo.
