You use a <CODE>protoFloatNGo </CODE>as your base and add your formula elements to it. The only requirements are:<BR><BR>    1. There must be an <CODE>overview </CODE>slot that contains the text to show in the formula's overview.<BR><BR>    2. <CODE>viewbounds.bottom </CODE>must be the height of your panel.<BR><BR>    3. There must be a <CODE>protoTitle </CODE>whose <CODE>title </CODE>slot is the name of the formula panel.<BR></DL>
