If the package is installed on a card and the card is removed, the user gets the following error message:<BR><BR>    "The package &lt;The package name&gt; still needs the card you removed.  Please insert it now, or information on the card may be damaged."<BR><BR>    How can I avoid this problem?<BR><BR>A:    Currently, the cardfile <CODE>AddLayout </CODE>method requires that the symbol in the layout is internal.  This bug will be fixed in a future ROM.  To work around this, do the following:<BR><BR><CODE><PRE>local newLayout := {_proto: GetLayout("A Test Layout")};newLayout.symbol := EnsureInternal (newLayout.symbol);GetRoot().cardfile:AddLayout(newLayout);</PRE><BR></CODE>    For more information about issues for applications running from a PCMCIA card, see the article "The Newton Still Needs the Card You Removed"<BR></DL>
