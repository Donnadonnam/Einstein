The method is defined by the overview and you should call the inherited one. Also note that <CODE>HitItem </CODE>gets called regardless of where in the line a tap occurs. If the tap occurs in the checkbox, you should do nothing, otherwise you should do something.<BR><BR>    The method is passed the index of the hit item. The index is relative to the item displayed at the top of the displayed list. This item is always the current entry of the cursor used by <CODE>protoSoupOverview</CODE>. So, you can find the actual soup entry by cloning the cursor and moving it.<BR><BR>    Here is an example of a <CODE>HitItem </CODE>method. If the item is selected (the checkbox is not tapped) then the code will set an inherited cursor (called <CODE>myCursor</CODE>) to the entry that was tapped on:<BR><BR><CODE><PRE>func(itemIndex, x, y)begin    // MUST call the inherited method for bookeeping    inherited:HitItem(itemIndex, x, y);        if x &gt; selectIndent then    begin  // get a temporary cursor based on the cursor used  // by soup overview        local tCursor := cursor:Clone();  // move it to the selected item        tCursor:Move(itemIndex) ;  // move the inherited cursor to the selected entry        myCursor:Goto(tCursor:Entry());  // usually you will close the overview and switch to  // some other view        self:Close();    end;    // otherwise, just let them check/uncheck // which is the default behaviorend</CODE></PRE></DL>
