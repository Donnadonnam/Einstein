This sampleproject creates a keyboard which looks like the American QWERTY keyboard.Note that the key sound is not yet implemented. If you want the familiarkeyboard sound you will have to add your own sound to the proto.Version 3-Added viewbounds & viewjustify slots in the keypad to let it work with  Newton 2.0Added _keyboard support so that double-tap in the view will open the   keyboard in Newton 2.0.
