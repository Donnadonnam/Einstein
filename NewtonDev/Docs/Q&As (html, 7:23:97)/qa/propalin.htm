For instance, if I have a view which is full justified or center justified, proportional view alignment doesn't seem to work at all.  Whats wrong?<BR><BR>A:    Proportional justification only works if you are using left, right, top, or bottom justification.  This is true for both sibling and parent justification.<BR><BR>    Proportional justification is very similar to full justification.  The view system needs some reference point at which to position the view.  If you specify full or center justification, and you are also using proportional justification, the reference point is undefined.<BR><BR>    Additionally, if you are using right or bottom justification, you will need to specify negative values for your proportional bounds.  For instance, if you want a view to take up the right 30 percent of its parent, you would specify the following view bounds:<BR><CODE><PRE>    {left: -30, top: &lt;top&gt;, right: 0, bottom: &lt;bottom&gt;}</PRE><BR></CODE><BR>    and the following view justification:<BR><CODE><PRE>    vjParentRightH + vjLeftRatio</CODE></PRE></DL>
