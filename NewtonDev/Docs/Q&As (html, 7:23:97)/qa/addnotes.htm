If the 2nd paramater (addit) is <CODE>TRUE</CODE>, it will add that frame to the Notes soup and show the note on the screen.  If addIt is <CODE>NIL</CODE>, then the frame is returned.<BR><BR>    It's the adding and showing that require the Notes app to be open, not the frame creation.  For instance, to add a note to the default store, do something like:<BR><BR><CODE><PRE>    newNote := GetRoot().paperroll:MakeTextNote("Here is a sample note", nil);    GetUnionSoup("Notes"):AddToDefaultStoreXmit(newNote, '|appSym:SIG|)</CODE></PRE></DL>
