This is because the entire routing formats would// be unnecessarily "EnsureInternaled" (copied into NewtonScript memory). Only for// "application/form" parts, the InstallScripts are EnsureInternaled when the package// is installed. By referencing them like partFrame.theForm.myFormats, the formats// are not referenced by the installScript itself and will not be unnecessarily copied.installScript := func(partFrame)	begin		local myFormats := partFrame.theForm.myFormats;			RegisterViewDef(myFormats.myPrintFormat, kMyDataClass);		RegisterViewDef(myFormats.myFrameFormat, kMyDataClass);	end;	removeScript := func(partFrame)	begin		UnRegisterViewDef(kMyPrintFormatSym, kMyDataClass);		UnRegisterViewDef(kMyFrameFormatSym, kMyDataClass);	end;
