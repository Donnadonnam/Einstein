After calling the inherited method, you can call <CODE>self:LocalBox() </CODE>and get the correct page size.  Note that you cannot rely on the <CODE>protoPrintFormat.viewBounds</CODE> slot value. To position subviews within the print format centered or "full" width or height, use  view  justifications like centered, right, and full, or use <CODE>theEnclosingView:LocalBox()</CODE> to determine the exact size of the enclosing view.</DL>
