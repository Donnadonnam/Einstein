* Einstein 2006.6 (2006/5/31)
Features:
- Initial release of Relativity for Einstein.
- Accelerated some transfers between Einstein and Host.
- Included several keyboard mappings.
- Update of PortAudio (from CVS).
- Included a new set of icons by Michael Vac√≠k. The toolbar icons reflect the state of Einstein.
- Fixed an endianess problem with the Cocoa screen manager on Intel machines.
- The state is now shown on the screen (instead of just: screen is off).
- Improved the Cocoa preferences panel.
- Included AppleScript support to evaluate newton script code and to install packages.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed a bad bug in the memory emulation that caused crashes, especially with the JIT page cache.
