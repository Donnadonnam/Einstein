Newton Developer Technical Support Sample CodeMooUnit, Unit Import/Export sampleby Mike Engber for Newton Developer Technical SupportCopyright © 1995 by Apple Computer, Inc.  All rights reserved.You may incorporate this sample code into your applications withoutrestriction.  This sample code has been provided "AS IS" and theresponsibility for its operation is 100% yours.  You are not permitted tomodify and redistribute the source as "DTS Sample Code." If you are goingto re-distribute the source, we require that you make it clear in thesource that the code was descended from Apple-provided sample code, butthat you've made changes.This sample shows how one part can make use of object in another partusing the new units mechanism. It also shows how to gracefully dealwith unavailable units and available units being removed.The MooUnit package consists of a single auto part that provides abovine sound and graphic. The MooUser package consists of a single formpart that utilizes the bovie sound and graphic.To fully experience this sample code, you should try a variety ofconfigurations:- With only MooUser installed, try to open MooUser.- With both MooUser and MooUnit installed, scrub MooUnit.- With both MooUser and MooUnit installed and MooUser open,  remove MooUnit.Points of Interest:  - MooUser won't open without MooUnit installed. See MooUser's  ButtonToggleScript (base view) for details.- MooUser warns the user of the consequences of deleting MooUnit.  See MooUser's RemovalApproval script (MooUser.f) for details.- MooUser closes if MooUnit is removed  See MooUser's ImportDisabled script (MooUser.f) for details.- bovine sound provided courtesy of Jeremy Wyld
