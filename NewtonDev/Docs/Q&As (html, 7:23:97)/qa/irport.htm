Data is communicated along a 500 KHz carrier frequency at 9600 or 19200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, odd parity.  The IR hardware requires a minimum of 5 milliseconds settling time when transitioning between sending and receiving.  Sharp's CE-IR2 wireless interface unit may be used to connect the Newton to MacOS or DOS machines, with the appropriate software.<BR><BR>    The Newton supports four IR software data modes:<BR>    Sharp encoding, NewtIR protocol (specifications are NOT releaseable)<BR>    Sharp encoding, SharpIR protocol<BR>    Plain Serial<BR>    38 KHz encoding ("TV Remote Control")</DL>
