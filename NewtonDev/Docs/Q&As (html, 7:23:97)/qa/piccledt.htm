The Notes "Note" view is basically a plain old <CODE>clEditView</CODE>, and <CODE>clEditViews </CODE>can contain pictures (in addition to ink, polygons, and text) in the Newton 2.0 OS.<BR><BR>    The Newton Programmer's Guide 2.0 (in the "Built-In Applications and System Data" chapter) contains a description of the types of children you can create in the Notes application.<BR><BR>    This is really a description of the frames you need to put in the <CODE>'viewChildren</CODE> slot of a <CODE>clEditView</CODE> to create editable items.  <CODE>'para</CODE> templates are text and ink text, <CODE>'poly</CODE> templates are drawings and sketch ink, and <CODE>'pict</CODE> templates are images.<BR><BR>    To add a picture to a <CODE>clEditView</CODE>, you need to create an appropriate template and then add it to the <CODE>viewChildren</CODE> array (and open the view or call <CODE>RedoChildren</CODE>) or use the <CODE>AddView</CODE> method to add it to an existing view (then <CODE>Dirty</CODE> the view.)  See the item "Adding Editable Text to a clEditView" elsewhere in the Q&amp;As for details.<BR><BR>    The template for <CODE>'pict</CODE> items needs to contain these slots:<BR><CODE>    viewStationery</CODE>:    Must have the symbol<CODE> 'pict<BR>    viewBounds</CODE>:        A bounds frame, like <CODE>RelBounds(0,0,40,40)<BR>    icon</CODE>:             A bitmap frame, see <CODE>clPictureView</CODE> docs<BR><BR>    For other slots, see the documentation for the <CODE>clPictureView </CODE>view class.</DL>
