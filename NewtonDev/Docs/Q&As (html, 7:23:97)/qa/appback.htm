Do not set another application to be the backdrop application. <CODE>GetRoot():BlessApp(appSymbol) </CODE>will close the current backdrop application and open the new backdrop application if necessary. Note that <CODE>appSymbol</CODE> must be a valid application symbol of a current installed and active application. <CODE>BlessApp</CODE> does NOT verify that an application can become the backdrop (for instance, it doesn't check the <CODE>'noBackdrop</CODE> flag for an application). For this reason, <CODE>BlessApp</CODE> must only be used on your own  applications. See the Newton DTS Q&amp;A, "How to Prevent an Application from Becoming a Backdrop" for more information about the <CODE>'noBackdrop</CODE> flag.<BR><BR>    Do not call  <CODE>BlessApp</CODE> from within a part's  <CODE>installScript</CODE> or <CODE>removeScript</CODE>. If you want to do something like this, use a delayed call to use <CODE>BlessApp</CODE>.  <BR><BR>    </DL>
