Printing always looks fine on a fax or bitmap printer like the StyleWriter.<BR><BR> A:    Yes, this is true.The additional System font (Espy Sans) or any custom Newton font created with the Newton Font Tool is not printed directly to a LaserWriter because the fonts are missing in the PostScript font versions. Just printing Espy Sans (Newton system fonts) is currently not possible on the LaserWriter, but is possible on faxes and bitmap printer drivers, since the rendering for those is done inside the Newton.<BR><BR>    For the built-in Espy font, the troublesome characters are the Apple-specific ones, starting with Hex FC. The filled diamond is one of these characters, the specific tick box arrow is another.<BR><BR>    For printing, you might need to include bitmaps for special characters or words in your application in order to print them (that is, if the normal LaserWriter fonts are unacceptable)<BR><BR>    Note that if you want a monospaced font, check out the DTS sample "<CODE>MonacoTest</CODE>". That includes a font which will print as the monospaced Courier font.<BR></DL>
