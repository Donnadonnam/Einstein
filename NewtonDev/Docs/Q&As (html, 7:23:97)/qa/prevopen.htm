What's the best way to prevent it?<BR><BR>A:    Check for whatever constraints or requirements you need early, if not in the <CODE>installScript</CODE>, then in the <CODE>viewSetupFormScript</CODE> for the application's base view.  In your case, you can do some math on the frame returned from <CODE>GetAppParams </CODE>to see if the screen is large enough to support your application.<BR><BR>    If you do not want the application to open, do the following:<BR>    &#149; Call <CODE>Notify</CODE> to tell the user why your application cannot run.<BR>    &#149;  Set the base view's <CODE>viewBounds</CODE> so it does not appear, use<BR><CODE>            RelBounds(-10, -10, 0, 0)</CODE> so the view will be off-screen.<BR>    &#149;  Possibly set (and check) a flag so expensive startup things do not happen.<BR>    &#149;  Possibly set the base view's <CODE>viewChildren </CODE>and <CODE>stepChildren </CODE>slots to NIL.<BR>    &#149;  call <CODE>AddDeferredSend(self, 'Close, nil)</CODE> to close the view.</DL>
