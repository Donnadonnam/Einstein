First I setup an initial string (might aswell use viewIdleScript(), otherwise I would just end up duplicating code).Then call the SetupIdle() call and pass it 1000 milliseconds (1 second). Thissays, call my viewIdleScript() in 1 second. (NOTE: pass 0 or NIL to disable theidle behavior).¥viewIdleScriptFirst, a constant used to specify a time specification (really). This is used bythe TimeStr() function (and also by ShortDateStr() and LongDateStr()). Take alook at those manuals, chapter 18...First I figure out the current seconds. The Time() function returns minutessince January 1 1904, TimeInSeconds() returns seconds since January 1 1993 (notethe different years). So I do a bit of trickery to get the current seconds (wellnot much trickery). And remember, the string needs to always have 2 digits, sopad it if needed.Next, set my text value, simple huh? This SetValue call makes sure the text isupdated on the display.Finally, return 1000 milliseconds so that the script will get called the nextsecond. Is this easy or what...DANGER WILL ROBINSON... Remember that idle scripts are potential battery sinks.Just leave that sucker going and watch the battery meter drop... I should reallybe doing a minute (60000 millisecond) update to be nice. Then I could just useTime(), gosh Batman, it could have been easier, but then this would not be DTS,and I would not be....Dr. What
