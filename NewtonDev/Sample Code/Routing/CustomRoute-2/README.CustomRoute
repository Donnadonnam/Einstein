It does not require your base viewto handle everything or for your application to have a single globalrouting frame which applies to your application.CustomRoute takes advantage of context sensitive routing by displayinga subview an the application, to attempt to illustrate which messagesare context sensitive and which messages MUST be implemented in yourbase view.In the top subview, there is data which corresponds to a format whichcan display "view stuff" and "text"... which means that the dataTypes slotvalue is ['view, 'text].This sample also handles put away for beam, mail, or any third party'frame transport that comes along. Note that your putawayscript shouldcheck to see whether it can handle the data before trying to put it away!In order handle print and fax, you must register at least one protoPrintFormat.In order handle beam and mail, you must register at least protoFrameFormat.If you want to handle just frame or just text, use a protoFrameFormat andoverride the dataTypes slot to be ['frame] or ['text] and be sure to set thetext in the format's textScript if necessary.
