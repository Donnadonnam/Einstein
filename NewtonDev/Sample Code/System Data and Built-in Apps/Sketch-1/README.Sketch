It is passed a 		frame indicating x and y scroll offsets.Finding data	Sketch DataDef	- The FindFn method is called by Newton Works when a global ("Everywhere")		find is performed.	- The FindSoupExcerpt method is also used by the Newton's global		find mechanism.  It is called to get a title to display in the find		slip for a particular item.	Sketch ViewDef.lyt	- The ShowFoundItem method is called when the user selects an item from the		Newton's global find slip. - TheFindChange method is called when the user has		selected to perform a Newton Works find.Showing Inforamtion	Sketch DataDef	- The InfoBoxExtract method is called when Newton Works is displaying the title slip.Saving Data	Sketch ViewDef.lyt	- The SaveData method is called periodically to save the data.Manipulating the status bar	Sketch ViewDef.lyt	- The UpdateStatusBar method is called when Newton Works is manipulating the status bar.	- The statusLeftButtons and statusRightButtons slots hold an array of button		frames for use in the status bar.Registering and using tools	Sketch ViewDef.lyt	- The ToolsChanged, AddToolKeyCommand, and RemoveToolKeyCommand methods are of		interest here.  They show how to dynamically add and remove tools while Sketch		is being used.	- The Tools button in StatusLeftButtons shows how to correctly build a a popup		list of installed tools.Notes:Sketch uses protoRecToggle in a non-standard way.  Normally when you use aprotoRecToggle, you would have a _recogSettings slot somewhere within theheriarchy of the edit view.  Since we are using stationery, it is not wise toadd or modify any slots in the base application.  As a result, Sketch changesthe _recogSettings slot in the edit view each time the user chooses a newrecognition setting from the protoRecToggle popup.  See the button definitionin the view definitions statusLeftButtons slot for more information.If you enable "Compile for Debugging", each call to a Newton Works specificmethod will print information to the inspector window.
