For detailed information about the protoFSM object, how to useit, and an accompanying article, see the "protoFSM" DTS sample code project.To assist in the understanding of the Altered States sample, it may bebeneficial to review the Altered States FSM Diagram document and theExampleFSM source file(s) while running the code. Altered States is avery simple machine with only five states and two events, so it's a goodplace to start if you're new to finite state machine construction on the Newton.Altered States also demonstrates two methods of organizing your state machinecode: by NTK Layout, and by Text File.  The former takes advantage of the NTK3-pane browser, while the later allows state machine templates generated byexternal applications to be compiled into self-contained FSM templatesequivalent to the NTK Layout approach.  Some programmers may prefer to use textfiles rather than layout files to organize their code, or to take advantage ofexisting source code control systems.  protoFSM gives you the flexibility youneed at a price you can afford.
