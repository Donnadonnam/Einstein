For compatibility, you should always make sure the corrector exists.  The corrector itself requires that a correctable key view exists.<BR><BR><CODE><PRE>local correctView := GetRoot().correct;if correctView and (GetCaretBox() or GetHiliteOffsets()) then   correctView:Open();</PRE><BR></CODE>    Note: An older version of this Q&amp;A (from 12/8/95) showed using <CODE>GetKeyView</CODE> as a test to make sure a correctable view was the key view.  With the changes to the OS with the Newton 2.1 release that allow any view to be a key view, this is no longer a reliable test.  The corrector will fail to open (generating a -48204 "bad path" error) if the key view does not support the caret or a selection.  Calling <CODE>GetCaretBox</CODE> and <CODE>GetHiliteOffsets</CODE> is a more reliable test to see if a correctable view is available.</DL>
