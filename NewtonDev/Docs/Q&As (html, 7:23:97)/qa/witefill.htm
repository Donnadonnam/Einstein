How do I draw white text?<BR><BR>A:    kRGB_White has some unusual behavior. If you want a white-on-black effect then you will need to use one of two workarounds:<BR><BR>    For white text on a filled background using a style frame, set your background to the desired shade using either the fill color of the view or a filled object (in other words, do not do this just by setting the color fill of the text). Then use the <CODE>textPattern</CODE> slot in the style frame to make the text black (<CODE>kRGB_Black</CODE>) and set the <CODE>transferMode</CODE> to <CODE>modeBic</CODE>.<BR><BR>    For white text on black using the color slot of the viewFont frame, use <CODE>kRGB_Gray1</CODE> for something that is as close to white as you can get.<BR></DL>
