This sample provides two user protos you can use for buttons that conform tothe User Interface Guidelines.The user protos are:protoAdjustoButton - use for a stand alone buttonprotoAdjustoClusterButton - user for a cluster of buttons....also included is protoResizeApp, a slight extension to protoApp thatresizes the base view based on the screen size and max sizes.protoAdjustoButton------------------You can use this wherever you would use a normal button. At runtime the buttonwill adjust its size based on the text in the button. If you use SetValueto change the text slot, the button will resize to the new text.Note that the size of the button is calculated relative to the top leftas specified in the viewBounds.The relevant slots and methods are:text	The string to appear in the button (Must be provided)	viewBounds	The size of the button. Only the top and left values are used.	The viewBounds will be readjusted at viewSetupFormScript time.	You must provide a viewBounds.	textSpacer (optional)	The total space to leave on each side of the text of the button.	The default is 8 (4 pixels of white space on either side of the text)	buttonHeight (optional)	The height of the button. Currently set to 13 as per the User Interface	GuidelinesviewSetupFormScript	Defined by protoAdjustoButton. This will set the viewBounds to the	new value.   If you override the viewSetupFormScript, make sure you	call inherited:?viewSetupFormScript to change the size.	viewChangedScript	Defined by protoAdjustoButton to respond to a change in the text slot.	Does call the inherited value.	protoAdjustoClusterButton-------------------------This proto is designed to be used inside an enclosing cluster view (a clViewworks fine). The first button is a cluster must have a viewBounds specifiedfor it (the alternative is to provide a protoAdjustoFirstClusterButton).The proto is based on protoAdjustoButton. The slots and methods are thesame as for protoAdjustoButton except for:	viewBounds	Set by the proto. You should override the viewBounds of the first button	in the cluster. Change the left value to 4.	viewJustify	Set by the proto to sibling justify the buttons.	viewChangedScript	This also sends a SyncChildren and Dirty to the parent of the	button so that all the buttons maintain the same relationship when a 	button width changes.
