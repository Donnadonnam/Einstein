Eventually, you will be able to set a <CODE>viewFont </CODE>slot in the <CODE>protoListPicker </CODE>itself and have that work (just like you can set <CODE>viewLineSpacing </CODE>slot now). In the meantime, you need a piece of workaround code. Warning: you must set the viewFont of the listPicker AND include this workaround code in the <CODE>viewSetupDoneScript</CODE>:<BR><BR><CODE><PRE>func()    begin       if listBase exists and listBase then          SetValue(listBase, 'viewFont, viewFont) ;           inherited:?viewSetupDoneScript();    end;</PRE><BR></CODE>    This will set the <CODE>viewFont </CODE>slot of the <CODE>listBase</CODE> view to the <CODE>viewFont </CODE>of the <CODE>protoListPicker</CODE>. You cannot rely on the listbase view always being there, hence the test for its existence.<BR><BR>    Note that you can use the same code to modify the <CODE>lineHeight</CODE> slot of the listPicker. Just substitute <CODE>lineHeight</CODE> for <CODE>viewFont</CODE> in the code snippet. The one caveat is that the <CODE>lineHeight</CODE> must be at least 13 pixels.</DL>
