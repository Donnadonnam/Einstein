Is this a known bug?<BR><BR>A:    Yes, this is a known bug in <CODE>RemoveTempItems</CODE>.  The call to <CODE>RemoveTempItems</CODE> does not clear out the cache of selected items correctly.  This will be fixed in a future version of the Newton OS.<BR><BR>    To workaround the problem, assume the following:  If your transport's communications channel is not currently connected and you receive a request with its cause slot set to <CODE>'remote</CODE>, assume that the cause slot is actually <CODE>'user</CODE> and act accordingly.  If you receive a request with its <CODE>'cause</CODE> slot set to <CODE>'remote </CODE>and your transport's communications channel is connected then perform the appropriate action for receiving remote items.<BR></DL>
