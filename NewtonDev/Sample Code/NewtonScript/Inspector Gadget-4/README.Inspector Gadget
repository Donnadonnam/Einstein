The Newton isvery bad at recognizing NewtonScript so you use the keyboard a lot, and it’shard to edit... but you can do some neat oneliners.  Send your cool onelineNewtonScript hacks to PIEDTS!The old WallyMath sample has been integrated now, for mathematical expressionsjust write in the expression and an = sign.
