Can I make my application open the help book when the user chooses "Help" from the info button?<BR><BR>A:     Yes, there is a <CODE>newtApplication</CODE> slot called <CODE>helpManual</CODE>.  You should store a reference to your help book in this slot.<BR><BR>    There is also a slot called <CODE>viewHelpTopic</CODE> which you can use to dynamically change the location the help book is opened to.  This slot should store the name of the topic to open to.<BR><BR>    See the DTS Sample Code project "Beyond Help" for an example of a help book.</DL>
