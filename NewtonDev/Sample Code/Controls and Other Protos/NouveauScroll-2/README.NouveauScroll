It gives 3 examples.Two show scrolling a simple text list, one that uses a vanilla scroller.The other uses accellerated scrolling and feedback.Version 2 of this sample adds a floating window with a scrolling paragraphthat's sized to fit the text.Version 2 also adjusted the locations of the scroll controls to match theUI guidelines, putting the scrollers within the scrolled content.  Theview heirarchies and scroller viewbounds are adjusted to match.An editable scrollable text view is much trickier than it looks, becauseonce editing is allowed the size of the paragraph can change and thecaret can be moved, so fairly complicated code needs to be added to keepthe caret on-screen and keep the scrollers in sync with the editor.
