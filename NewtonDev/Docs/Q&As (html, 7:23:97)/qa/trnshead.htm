The height of the transport header will be increased by this amount.<BR><BR>    Next, add the following code to the <CODE>viewSetupFormScript </CODE>method of your <CODE>protoTransportHeader </CODE>view. This works around a bug  with <CODE>protoTransportHeader:<BR></CODE>    <BR>         <CODE><PRE>        self.stepChildren := SetUnion( self._proto.stepChildren,           self._proto._proto.stepChildren, true );</PRE><BR></CODE>                                <BR>    Finally, use NTK as you normally would to create the child views.<BR></DL>
