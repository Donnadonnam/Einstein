It says that incoming items will be filed when they are received, however it appears that they are actually filed when they are read.  Is the documentation incorrect?<BR><BR>A:    Yes, the documentation is incorrect.  Items are filed when they have been read, not when they have been received.  The default for <CODE>inboxFiling</CODE> is <CODE>nil</CODE>.<BR><BR>        Note that if the In/Out Box is not the backdrop application, filing does not occur until you close the In/Out Box.  If the In/Out Box is the backdrop application, filing occurs when the user switches between the overview and the main view.</DL>
