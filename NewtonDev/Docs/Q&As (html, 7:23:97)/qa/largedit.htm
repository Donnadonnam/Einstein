After a few pages it stops scrolling.  What is going wrong?<BR><BR>A:    Both <CODE>newtEditView</CODE> and <CODE>newtROEditView</CODE> have a default scroll height of 2,000 pixels.  To work around this limitation, you will need to add a slot called <CODE>noteSize</CODE> to your <CODE>newt(RO)editView</CODE>.  This slot should hold an array of two elements.  The first element is the scroll width.  If you do not want horizontal scrolling, the scroll width should equal the view width.  The second element is the <CODE>scrollHeight</CODE>.<BR><BR>    Here is an example <CODE>noteSize</CODE> slot that you would use to create a <CODE>newt(RO)EditView</CODE> with a scroll height of 20,000 pixels.<BR><BR>    <CODE><PRE>    {        _proto:        newtEditView,    noteSize:    [viewWidth, 20000],    ...</PRE><BR>    }</CODE><BR></DL>
