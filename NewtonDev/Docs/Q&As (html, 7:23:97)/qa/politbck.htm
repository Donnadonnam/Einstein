If your applications close box  is based on <CODE>protoCloseBox </CODE>or <CODE>protoLargeCloseBox </CODE>then your close box will automatically hide itself if your application is the backdrop application. If you also use <CODE>newtStatusBar </CODE>as your status bar proto, the appropriate buttons will shift to fill the gap left by the missing close box. Note that you do not have to use the NewtApp framework to use the <CODE>newtStatusBar </CODE>proto.<BR><BR>    The system will automatically override the <CODE>Close </CODE>and <CODE>Hide </CODE>methods so your application cannot be closed.<BR><BR>    If you need to know which application is the backdrop application, you can find the appSymbol of the current backdrop app with <CODE>GetUserConfig('blessedApp)</CODE>.<BR><BR>    Here are some tips on being a polite backdrop application:<BR>    &#149; Your application should be full-screen.  (Set "Styles" as the backdrop to see why.)<BR>    &#149; A polite backdrop application will also add the registered auxiliary buttons to its status bar. See the "Using Auxiliary Buttons" in the Newton Programmers Guide (Chapter 18.)</DL>
