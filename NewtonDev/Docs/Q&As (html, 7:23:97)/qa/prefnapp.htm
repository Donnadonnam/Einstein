What is the best way to do this?<BR><BR>A:    You can save application-specific information in the frame in the <CODE>prefsCache</CODE> slot of your NewtApp-based application.  This slot is defined in your application's base view by the NewtApp framework.  This frame will be saved to the system soup when the application closes.  <BR><BR>    When you add to the <CODE>prefsCache</CODE> frame, you must use your registered signature to avoid conflicting with slots that the framework may use.  You can name each of your preferences with your signature, or we recommend adding a subframe in a slot named with your signature.  For instance, you might have the following code:<BR><BR>        <CODE>prefsCache.('|MyPrefs:MySIG|) := {pref1: 1, pref2: 2};</CODE><BR></DL>
