Alkaline batteries provide less current than NiCad due to higher internal resistance. There is also a 'semi' artifical limit in the ROM. Currently any card who's CIS indicates more than 200 mA current draw will be rejected by the CardHandler. Other than that, here's the run down by hardware:<BR><BR><CODE><PRE>    Apple MessagePad 100:      50 mA    Apple MessagePad 110:    ~160 mA    Apple MessagePad 120:    ~300 mA    Apple MessagePad 130:    ~300 mA (with backlight off)    Apple MessagePad 130:    (with backlight on, the maximum has not been characterized)</CODE></PRE></DL>
