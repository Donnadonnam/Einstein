I've checked that the tool is installed properly, and the DIL sample application works fine. What's wrong?<BR><BR>A:    A common cause of this error code is that the CSTR resources haven't been linked into your final executable.  Those resources are used to find the filenames of the communications tools.  Add the resource file named "<CODE>CSTR.rsrc</CODE>" to your project and see if that fixes things.</DL>
