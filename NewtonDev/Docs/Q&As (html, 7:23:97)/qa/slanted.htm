I don't mean italics, but actually drawing a word at a 45 or 60  degree angle and so on.  For example, can text be drawn along a line that goes from 10,10 to 90,90 (45 degrees)?<BR><BR>A:    The drawing package in the Newton OS supports no calls for rotating text. Note: this is like QuickDraw in the MacOS operating system. In MacOS, the workaround is to draw the text into a bitmap and then rotate the bits; you can do the same on a Newton device.  In the Newton OS, we even provide calls to rotate a bitmap in 90 degree increments.<BR><BR>    You might consider creating a font having characters that are pre-rotated to common angles (such as 30 or 45 degrees) so that applications could just draw characters rather than actually having to rotate a bitmap.</DL>
