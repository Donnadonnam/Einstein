When I call <CODE>EntryChange</CODE> on the modified entry I get a -48022 error. What is wrong?<BR><BR>A:    There is a known bug in Newton OS 2.0 (which is fixed in Newton OS 2.1) that can cause this problem. It can occur when you initially create an entry with an empty array as the value of the tag index slot. The workaround is not to use the empty array. Use NIL instead. If you need to add an array of tags later, you can do so.</DL>
