Itturns out to be quite easy; just use GetNamedResource to get the PICT resourceand give it the class 'picture.For best results (and to save package space) you should use any Mac graphicseditor to convert your images to 16 shades of greyscale and use the standard 16greys color palette, but it isn't strictly necessary to do this, as even a 256color PICT will be converted on the Newton device if necessary.
