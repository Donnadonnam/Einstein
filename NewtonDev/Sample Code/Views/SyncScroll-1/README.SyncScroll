SyncScrollThis example shows how to use SyncScroll with your views. Note that SyncScrolltakes an array of view templates, not child views, in order to scroll them. Thismeans the height slot must be stored in each NTK template, not the view itself.This means that in order for the height slot to match the viewbounds, youprobably want to set the height in afterscripts based on the viewbounds slot.Also note that there is an omission in version 1.0 of the Newton Programmer'sGuide SyncScroll documentation. If you use an array argument instead of a cursorthe view that recieves the SyncScroll message must have a slot called index.This is initially set to the index of the first child displayed. Each call toSyncScroll will modify this value to be the child displayed at the top.J. Christopher BellPIEDTS
