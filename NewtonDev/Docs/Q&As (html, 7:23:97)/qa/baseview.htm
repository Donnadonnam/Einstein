This function is handy if you want to check for unnecessary slots stored in the application base view; these eat up the NewtonScript heap and eventually cause problems with external PCMCIA RAM cards.<BR><BR><CODE><PRE>    call func()     begin        local s,v;        local root := GetRoot();        local base := root.|YourApp:YourSIG|; // name of app        local prot := base._proto;        foreach s,v in base do        begin            if v and v &lt;&gt; root AND v &lt;&gt; base AND v &lt;&gt; prot then              begin               Write ("Slot:" && s & ", Value: ");               Print(v);              end;        end;    end with ()</PRE><BR></CODE>    The debugging function <CODE>TrueSize</CODE> can also be a valuable tool to determine the heap used by your applications.
