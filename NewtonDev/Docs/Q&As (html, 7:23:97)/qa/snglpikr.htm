That means that the particular class of nameRef you use must include single selection. In general, this requires creating your own subclass of the particular name reference class.<BR><BR>    The basic solution is to create a data definition that is a subclass of the particular class that your <CODE>protoListPicker </CODE>variant will view. That data definition will include the <CODE>singleSelect </CODE>slot. As an example, suppose you want to use a <CODE>protoPeoplePopup </CODE>that just picks individual people. You could use the following code to bring up a <CODE>protoPeoplePopup </CODE>that only allowed selecting one individual at one time:<BR><BR><CODE><PRE>    // register the modified data definition    RegDataDef('|nameref.people.single:SIG|,    {_proto: GetDataDefs('|nameRef.people|), singleSelect: true});    // then pop the thing    protoPeoplePopup:New('|nameref.people.single:SIG|,[],self,[]);    // sometime later    UnRegDataDef('|nameref.people.single:SIG|);</PRE><BR></CODE>    For other types of <CODE>protoListPickers</CODE> and classes, create the appropriate subclass. For example, a transport that uses <CODE>protoAddressPicker </CODE>for emails might create a subclass of <CODE>'|nameRef.email|</CODE> and put that subclass symbol in the <CODE>class </CODE>slot of the <CODE>protoAddressPicker</CODE>.<BR><BR>    Since many people are likely to do this, you may cut down on code in your <CODE>installScript </CODE>and <CODE>removeScript </CODE>by registering your dataDef only for the duration of the picker. That would mean registering the class just before you pop the picker and unregistering after the picker has closed. You can use the <CODE>pickActionScript </CODE>and <CODE>pickCanceledScript </CODE>methods to be notified when to unregister the dataDef.</DL>
