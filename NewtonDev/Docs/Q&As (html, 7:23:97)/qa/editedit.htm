If I drag out a <CODE>clParagraphView</CODE> child in NTK, the text is not selectable even if I turn on <CODE>vGesturesAllowed</CODE>. <BR><BR>A:    <CODE>clEditViews</CODE> have special requirements.  To create a text child of a <CODE>clEditView</CODE> that can be selected and modified by the user (as if it had been created by the user) you need to do the following:<BR><BR><CODE><PRE>    textTemplate := {        viewStationery: 'para,        viewBounds: RelBounds(20, 20, 100, 20),        text: "Demo Text",    };    AddView(self, textTemplate);</PRE><BR></CODE>    The view must be added dynamically (with <CODE>AddView</CODE>), because the <CODE>clEditView</CODE> expects to be able to modify the contents as the user edits this item.  The template (<CODE>textTemplate</CODE> above) should also be created at run time, because the <CODE>clEditView</CODE> adds some slots to this template when creating the view.  (Specifically it fills in the <CODE>_proto</CODE> slot based on the <CODE>viewStationery</CODE> value.  The <CODE>_proto</CODE> slot will be set to <CODE>protoParagraph</CODE>)  If you try to create too much at compile time, you will get -48214 (object is read only) errors when opening the edit view.<BR><BR>    The minimum requirements for the template are a <CODE>viewStationery</CODE> of <CODE>'para</CODE>, a <CODE>text</CODE> slot, and a <CODE>viewBounds</CODE> slot.  You can also set <CODE>viewFont</CODE>, <CODE>styles</CODE>, <CODE>tabs</CODE>, and other slots to make the text look as you would like.</DL>
