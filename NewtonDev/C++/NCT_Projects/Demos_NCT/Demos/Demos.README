There is also a NTK projectwhich shows how to call these functions.The actual work done by these functions is minimal, but they show howyou would get data (integers, strings, symbols, reals, etc) from theNewtonScript world into the C++ world.Files in here, and a quick description of each:  --- C++ files ---  Demos.cp        - C++ functions (the interesting file)  Demos.exp       - List of entrypoints to the C++ code  FilesInBuild    - List of files in the C++ project  Makefile        - Build instructions for the compiler  Objects:        - Folder containing compiler-generated output    Demos.ntkc    - What you add to your NTK project - the C++ Tools output    Demos.sym     - Symbols used by NewtsBug for debugging  --- NTK files ---  Demos           - NTK project file  Demos.pkg       - Package file (what you download to the Newton device)  Demos.t         - Layout file (where the UI is defined, such as it is)
