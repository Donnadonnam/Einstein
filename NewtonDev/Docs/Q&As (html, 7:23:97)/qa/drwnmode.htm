Is that true?<BR><BR>A:    Yes, at least this is true for PostScript printers. PostScript behaves like layers of paint: you can not go back and change something. Anything that uses an invert mode will not work. Specifically, <CODE>modeXOR</CODE> and <CODE>modeNot</CODE> will not work.<BR><BR>    If you want to get the effect of white text on a black/filled background, use bit clear mode (<CODE>modeBic</CODE>) for drawing the text.<BR><BR>    This does not affect non-PostScript print drivers, for instance, Apple StyleWriter printers and Fax.</DL>
