ThepeoplePicker queries the names soup and based on the dataClass of thepeoplePicker, display related information from the soup.  The dataClasses ofthe peoplePicker must be a nameRef with  a subClass.  The valid subClasses areeither fax, email, meetingPlaces, or people.  For more information aboutlistPicker see the documentation and listPicker Samples.See the protoTextList.viewSetupFormScript to see how to get the currently selected items in the protoPeoplePicker.Note that you may also consider using protoPeoplePopup instead. This proto provides the enclosing view for the protoPeoplePicker.
