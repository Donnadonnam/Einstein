We are not doing anything special to set up the modem so why are the system settings ignored?<BR><BR>A:    The user modem settings do not come for free. You must configure your endpoint based on the user settings. You can get these using the <CODE>MakeModemOption</CODE> call.<BR><BR>    In general, we recommend that you always use <CODE>MakeModemOption</CODE> when setting up options to intiailize an endpoint. So you would call <CODE>MakeModemOption</CODE> to get your initial option array, then add your own custom options after that.  <CODE>MakeModemOption</CODE> will return correct options based on the user settings for ignore DialTone, use PC Card Modem, etc.</DL>
