SoundTricks 3by Todd Courtois & Bob EbertCopyright © 1994-1995 by Apple Computer, Inc.  All rights reserved.SoundTricks is intended to demonstrate a couple tricks with sound on theNewton:1. Modifying the samplingRate of a sound sample to shift speed and pitch.2. Using StuffByte and ExtractByte on the actual sound samples to reverse asound.All of the interesting code is stored in the mainView's viewSetupFormScript and the setupBackwardsSound script.Note that I use buttonPressedScripts so that when you hold the button down youget interesting playback side-effects.Modifications for 2.0 include making the app into a protoFloatNGo for easymovement around the screen.Also, I made sure the Clone-ing was correct and efficient.Greatest change is that I first look to see if sound slots are nil beforecreating them.  This means you only need to create the sounds the first timethe app is opened.  During subsequent Open()s, the sound slots still containthe data so opening is much faster.Also removed some incorrect or misleading info about allowed samplingRates.Modifications for version 3 include:fixes to the backwards algorithm to speed them up (move loop invariants outside loops)Deferring setting up backwards sound until it's needed.  (With a UI to indicate it.)----Modifications for version 4:  I made SetupBackwardsSound be a native function, and declared variablesappropriately.  Before compiling native, it took ~570 ticks.  Native, it takes 11.Better than 50x speedup is fairly decent...   -daf
