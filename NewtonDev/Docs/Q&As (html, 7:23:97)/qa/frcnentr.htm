If I set the <CODE>forceNewEntry</CODE> slot to <CODE>nil</CODE> in my layout and open the application with a <CODE>nil</CODE> target, I can still see the entry view.  How can I avoid this?<BR><BR>A:    You will need to check for the existence of a target frame.  If one does not exist then close the entry view.<BR><BR>    You will not have this problem if you use stationery because the <CODE>newtApp</CODE> framework will not open the stationery if a target does not exist.</DL>
