These functions can allow an application to keep and manage recognition settings for multiple users.  These functions only manage information about the recognition settings, and no other user preference settings.  <BR><BR>    <CODE><PRE>    GetUserSettings()</PRE><BR></CODE>    This function returns a frame of the current user recognition settings; this frame is the argument for <CODE>SetUserSettings</CODE>.
