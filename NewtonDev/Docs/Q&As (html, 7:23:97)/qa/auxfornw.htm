Why am I getting this error?<BR><BR>A:    This error is caused by a bug in Newton Works.  You will get a -48204 error if you register an auxiliary button for Newton Works while Newton Works is closed.   To work around this problem, catch that particular exception and ignore it.  Here is a code example:<BR><BR><CODE><PRE>    try        RegAuxButton( kAppSymbol, {destApp: 'newtWorks, ...} );    onexception |evt.ex.fr| do        nil;</CODE></PRE></DL>
