How can I rotate left correctly?<BR><BR>A:    There is a bug in the Newton 2.0 OS that manifests when the row size of the unrotated bitmap is not an even byte boundary.  The result can be a shift of data up to 7 pixels.<BR><BR>    You can work around this bug most efficiently by replacing the left rotation with three calls to <CODE>MungeBitmap</CODE> using these operations: <CODE>'flipHorizontal</CODE>, <CODE>'flipVertical</CODE>, and <CODE>'rotateRight</CODE>.  (<CODE>'rotateRight</CODE> three times will work as well, but it is less efficient bacause flips are faster than rotates.)<BR><BR>    Remember: "Three Rights (or Two Flips and a Right) Make a Left".</DL>
