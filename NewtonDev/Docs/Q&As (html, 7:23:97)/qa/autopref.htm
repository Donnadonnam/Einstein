First, the application to which the item is put away must implement the <CODE>AutoPutAway</CODE> method.  Second, the transport configuration slot <CODE>'dontAutoPutAway</CODE> must be set to <CODE>nil</CODE> (or not be present).  This configuration slot is new to Newton 2.1 OS and must contain the value nil or the value <CODE>'never</CODE>.  If <CODE>nil</CODE>, items will be put away automatically provided the application defined by the item's <CODE>appSymbol</CODE> slot has the <CODE>AutoPutAway</CODE> method.  If <CODE>'never</CODE>, items will not be automatically put away regardless of whether the application defined by the item's <CODE>appSymbol</CODE> slot implements the <CODE>AutoPutaway</CODE> method. <BR><BR>    This new configuration preference is only used on Newton 2.1 OS and higher.</DL>
