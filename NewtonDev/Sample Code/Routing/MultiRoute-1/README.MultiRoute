Also contains an example of protoSoupOverview.** OVERVIEW METHODS The main choice you must make when routing from overview is whether to use acustom data class to represent your data, or to use the system "magic" class'newtOverview. You pass this symbol to CreateTargetCursor along with an arrayof items (or soup entry aliases) and you get the "target". If you used CreateTargetCursor, it is called a "multiple item target".When to use a custom data class:	* If you ever need more than one item on a Print/Fax page.	* You sometimes need to support dataTypes other than ['view, 'frame, 'text]	* You need to offer choices in the "format" picker in the routing slip	  When to use the 'newtOverview class:	* If you never need more than one item on a Print/Fax page.	* If ALL items have print formats registered on their own classes	* If ALL items have route formats registered that support 'text	* If ALL items have route formats registered that support 'frame	* You always support dataTypes ['view, 'frame, 'text], and no more dataTypes	   Note: 'view, 'frame, and 'text are the standard dataTypes for transports	* You never need to offer choices in the "format" picker in the routing slip	   This "decision" is made using a picker in the status bar. The only code in this sample code which uses this flag is the base view's GetTargetInfo method. See thatmethod for info.** HOW TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OVERVIEW METHODS:	* select multiple items	* tap the Action button, then Print (using print preview, if you like)	* use the protoPopInPlace button in the status bar to choose "NewtOverview Class"	* tap the Action button, then Print (using print preview, if you like)	* note that the custom data class (with the print format in THIS sample) prints	  multiple items on one page. 	* The 'newtOverview version prints one item per page and uses the default 	  print format for each item (the first non-overview print format that the	  system can find)** PRINTING MULTIPLE ITEMSFor info about displaying multiple items on one page, see the "MyPrintFormat.t" layout.** ON-SCREEN OVERVIEWS For info about using protoSoupOverview, see the "MultiRoute.t" layout in the "overview" view.** CHECKING MANY ITEMS (DEBUGGING ONLY)The Action button also provides an Action script (routeScript) thatchecks the first 50 items. This is to show how you might debug your multi-pageprinting code. We do NOT recommend you actually provide buttons which check largenumbers of items (for instance, no "check all" button). With medium or large soups,checking all items in a soup could cause out-of-memory exceptions and/or restarts.This is because the 'selected slot in the overview must keep track of ALL soup entryaliases for the selected items. Also, if many items are routed to the Out Box, a COPYof the selected array will be made for the Out Box item.jXopherSep 27, 1996llama@apple.com
