Why is this problem occuring?<BR><BR>A:    This is caused by a bug in <CODE>ItemCompleted</CODE>.  To work around this, you should check to make sure the folder exists before calling <CODE>ItemCompleted</CODE>.  If it does not exist, then set the transport's <CODE>'outboxFiling</CODE> preference to <CODE>nil</CODE>.  Here is a code example:<BR><CODE><PRE>// This code assumes that the current receiver (self) is your transportif NOT GetFolderStr( :GetConfig( 'outboxFiling ) ) then    :SetConfig( 'outboxFiling, nil );</CODE></PRE></DL>
