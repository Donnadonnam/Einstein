<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>Fissioner is a tool designed to generate bitmap information from TrueType
outline fonts, and can be used either by itself or in conjunction with another
tool called Fuser.</P>

<P>Used by itself, Fissioner can take a TrueType outline font and generate
a bitmap font at a given size, preserving the metrics and spacing of the
outline font. The resulting bitmap font can then be edited or simply installed
in the System and used as normal.</P>

<P>Used with Fuser, Fissioner can take a TrueType outline font ('sfnt')
and split it, creating 'nfnt' bitmaps which Fuser can then roll back into
the 'sfnt' as embedded bitmaps ('sbit' tables). The designer may edit and
modify the bitmaps before fusing if desired.</P>

<H3><BR>
Embedded Bitmaps</H3>

<P>This feature was mainly provided to allow Chinese/Japanese/Korean (CJK)
typography at small point sizes. Typically, CJK characters are far more
complex than their Roman counterparts, and without hinting, the outlines
of such characters can be reduced to little &quot;ink-blots&quot; at small
sizes. However, the complexity of the glyphs - and more importantly, the
sheer size of CJK glyph sets (A Chinese font typically has in excess of
12,000 glyphs) - precludes the use of instructing.</P>

<P>A workaround solution is to have two versions of each CJK font: an outline
font for the larger sizes (above 24pt) and a set of bitmaps for the commoner
small point sizes (16, 14, 12 and 10pt). This used to mean manually having
to change font (from the outline to the bitmap font) when you changed pointsize.</P>

<P>With the advent of AAT, however, the same font file can now contain both
bitmaps and outline data: where a bitmap exists, it is automatically used,
otherwise the outline data is used to generate the characters as normal.
The <B>embedded bitmaps</B> give designers of CJK fonts the best of both
worlds: nicely rounded glyphs at large sizes (from the outline data) and
legible, quickly-rendered glyphs at smaller sizes (from the bitmaps).</P>

<H3><BR>
Preserving Metrics</H3>

<P>There is one problem with using embedded bitmaps in a font - sometimes
the bitmap version of a font has completely different metrics than the outline
version. This often happens when designers widen glyphs in the font to improve
legibility. The result of embedding such a bitmap into an outline font can
be seen below.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="DodgyWaterfall.gif" WIDTH="464" HEIGHT="152" 
ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"></P>

<P>As you can see, the bitmap stands out like a sore thumb - it's far wider
than the other sizes, which were generated from outlines. To avoid this,
you should always try to design a bitmap version of the font with the same
metrics that the outline version would have.</P>

<P>Fortunately, if you use Fissioner, this problem will never arise. Because
Fissioner produces bitmaps straight from the outline font data, they have
the same spacing and other metrics as the outline-generated images at that
point size. Thus, the Fissioner-generated font bitmaps will fit in seamlessly
with the rest of the outline font (unless of course you radically change
the letterforms!)</P>

<H3><BR>
Versions</H3>

<P>The current version of Fissioner is a fat binary, meaning you can run
it on either a 68k machine or a PowerPC machine.</P>

<H3><BR>
Using Fissioner</H3>

<P>It is recommended that you make a copy of your original suitcase before
you begin, and store it somewhere other than in the folder in which you
intend to work.</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Double click the application to launch (the Fissioner application is
  not drag-launchable).Users of non-PowerPC Macintoshes should select Fissioner68k
  instead of FissionerPPC.

  </OL>
  <P><BR>
  
  <LI>The application will immediately come up asking you to select the outline
  font that you want to fission.

  </B>
  <LI>After you have selected the font, it will ask you what pointsize you
  wish to create the bitmaps for (the default is 12pt).
  <P><IMG SRC="FissionerChooseSize.gif" WIDTH="282" HEIGHT="110" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
  NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">
  <P>Enter the point-size of your choice, and click OK.
</OL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The application will generate suitcase(s) of 256 bitmaps each in the
same folder that contains your original outline font. The original font
is not modified.</P>

<P>If the original font contains more than 256 glyphs, the fissioner will
create multiple suitcases, named after the original 'sfnt', followed by
a number indicating the bitmap size and the sequence number of the suitcase.
For example, &quot;Chicago&quot;, when Fissioned for 12pt, creates two suitcases
called &quot;Chicago 12-1&quot; and &quot;Chicago 12-2&quot;, as shown below</P>

  NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" BORDER="0"></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Repeat all steps to create other bitmap sizes as desired.</P>

<P>At this point, the designer can choose to edit or modify the 'nfnt' bitmaps,
using a standard bitmap editor.</P>

<P>When the bitmaps have been edited, Fuser can be used to embed them into
the TrueType font.</P>

<H3><BR>
Caveats</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>Fuser will not recognize the 'nfnt' suitcases produced by Fissioner
  if their names have been changed. Also, Fuser uses the appended numbers
  (eg., the &quot;1&quot; in &quot;Chicago 12<B>-1</B>&quot;) to keep the
  glyphs in their correct order when it rolls the font back together. If,
  while editing the bitmaps, you wish to change suitcase names, make sure
  that the final versions - the ones you plan to embed as 'sbit's using the
  Fuser - have the same name(s) that they were given by the Fissioner.<BR>
  
  <LI>If you open up one of the bitmap suitcases, you will notice that the
  'nfnt' has the name &quot;X&quot; followed by the point size. In our Chicago
  example, it would be &quot;X 12&quot;.
  <P><IMG SRC="FissionerFontSample.gif" WIDTH="329" HEIGHT="328" X-SAS-UseImageWidth
  X-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">
  <P>Because this bitmap font is intended only as an intermediate step in
  the font design process, this name is not important. Nevertheless, the
  name should not be changed, because doing so would confuse Fuser later.<BR>
  
  <LI>Glyphs must not be deleted from or added to the bitmap fonts produced
  by Fissioner.
