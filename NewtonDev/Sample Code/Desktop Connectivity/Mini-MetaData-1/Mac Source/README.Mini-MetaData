Thisfile holds the cross-platform code which makes most of the DIL API calls.The routine SetupPortMenu() demonstrates how to dynamically find the namesof the available ports - these can be different on different models ofMacOS computers, and change in localized versions of the Macintosh System.See the Mini-MetaData NTJ article included with this sample for anin-depth discussion of how the sample works.
