WordArray-2, Recognition result example.by J. Christopher Bell, Newton Developer Tech Support.Copyright 1994-1995 by Apple Computer, Inc. All rights Reserved.You may incorporate this sample code into your applications withoutrestriction.  This sample code has been provided "AS IS" and theresponsibility for its operation is 100% yours.  You are notpermitted to modify and redistribute the source as "DTS Sample Code."If you are going to re-distribute the source, we require that youmake it clear in the source that the code was descended fromApple-provided sample code, but that you've made changes.This project shows you how to take advantage of the GetWordArray andGetScoreArray functions.These functions should be called in the viewWordScript of a view and not in theviewClickScript or viewStrokeScript. Note that the stroke can be completed(i.e. StrokeDone() returns true) but you may have only partially completed aletter or word. The viewWordScript message is sent after the system recognizesthe word, and only if the view is not one that normally supports wordrecognition.For example, views of the clParagraphView and clEditView class support wordrecognition, so will not normally receive this message. (However, if you setthe vReadOnly flag for these views, the viewWordScript message will be sent.)
