Stay tuned for more information concerning this. <BR><BR>    Some recognition engines can work in a window separate from the edited text. For instance, writing a "w" in a special view might causes "w" to appear in the currently edited text view (the key view.) This type of recognition system can be implemented as a keyboard. If you want to use this approach, you might want to use a function in the Newton 2.0 Platform file that allows your keyboard to replace the built-in alphanumeric "typewriter" keyboard. See the Platform File Notes documentation for more information on the <CODE>RegGlobalKeyboard </CODE>function.</DL>
