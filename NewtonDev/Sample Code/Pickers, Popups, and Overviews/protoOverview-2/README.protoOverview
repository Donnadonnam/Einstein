It illustrates the minimalamount of work you have to do to get one working. See the documentationfor more information on protoOverview.All the useful information is in the protoOverview portion of theprotoOverview.t layout. Almost all the slots are important.Version 2 - added fix required to update checkboxes in the HitItem methodof protoOverview:	local curs := cursor:Clone();	curs:Reset();	curs:Move(topIndex);	:SetupAbstracts(curs);	:Dirty();Note that this type of updating is not necessary with protoSoupOverview, which uses its 'selected array to update checked items.
