Also displayed in the listPicker is an icon that is read in from a resource file.  The icon is not part of the soup but may aid visual reference to listPicker items.  This behavior is similiar to the icons in the names applications.Important---------The line height of the listPicker can be changed but the justification of the checkBox cannot.  The checkBox always aligns with the bottom of the listPicker row.  Caution:  A large Icon and row height may give undesireable visual results.
