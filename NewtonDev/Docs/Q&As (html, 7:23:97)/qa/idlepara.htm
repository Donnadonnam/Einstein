(For example, an operation which results in the creation or changing of a keyboard's input focus within the view will trigger the viewIdleScript.)  Why does this happen and what can I do about it?<BR><BR>A:    The <CODE>clParagraphView</CODE> class internally uses the idle event mechanism to implement some of its features.  Unfortunately, any <CODE>viewIdleScript</CODE>s provided by developers also execute when the system idle events are processed.  Only the "heavyweight" views do this, "lightweight" paragraph views (in other words, simple static text views) do not.<BR><BR>    There is no workaround in the Newton 1.x OS or Newton 2.0 OS while using clParagraphView <CODE>viewIdleScript</CODE>.  You can either accept the extra idle script calls, or use another non-<CODE>clParagraphView</CODE> based view to implement your idle functions.<BR></DL>
