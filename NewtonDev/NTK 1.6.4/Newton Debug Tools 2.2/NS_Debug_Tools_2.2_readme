NS Debug Tools (2.2) is now available. You will need to use this updatedversion on any Newton 2.1 machines, as the older version of NS DebugTools will not work properly.The following changes have been made:NS Debug Tools.pkg        Rebuilt with "Newton 2.0 Platform Only", "Faster Functions (2.0 Only)",        "Tighter Object Packing (2.0 Only)" checked.        Restructured to use much less NewtonScript heap space when installed        on the Internal store.        QuickStackTrace, Where, and the data displayed when entering a break        loop now use the global variable stackTracePrintDepth to control how        how much data to display (just like the StackTrace function in the ROM).        Where, and the data displayed when entering a break loop now work when        stopped at a resend or resend-if-defined instruction (an exception was        being thrown while decompiling the parameters to the inherited message        send).        Rebuilt to work on Newton 2.1 as well as Newton 2.0        Redid the icon to meet the UI size standards.NSDShortCuts        Rebuilt with "Newton 2.0 Platform Only", "Faster Functions (2.0 Only)",        "Tighter Object Packing (2.0 Only)" checked.        Restructured to use much less NewtonScript heap space when installed        on the Internal store.        Sets the global variable stackTracePrintDepth to -1.        Added the following new shortcut functions:           args, argsi, getalllocalsi, getarg, getargi, getimpl, getimpli,           getselfi, gettop, gl, gli, gs, gsi, gv, gvi, r, replacetop, run,           setarg, setargi, sl, sli, ss, ssi, stopendfn, sv, svi, WhereIsSlot,           WhereIsSlotSet, values        See the file myFunctions in the folder NSDShortCuts, for explainations        of what they do.DebugHashToName.pkg        Rebuilt with "Newton 2.0 Platform Only", "Faster Functions (2.0 Only)",        "Tighter Object Packing (2.0 Only)" checked.
