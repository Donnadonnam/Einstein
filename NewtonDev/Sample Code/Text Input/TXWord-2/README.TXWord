This sample code has been provided "AS IS" and the**      responsibility for its operation is 100% yours.  You are not**      permitted to modify and redistribute the source as "DTS Sample Code."**      If you are going to re-distribute the source, we require that you**      make it clear in the source that the code was descended from**      Apple-provided sample code, but that you've made changes.*/This sample shows the basics of protoTXView, the Newton 2.1 Text Editor. Italso shows how to create font and size menus, range manipulation, text manipulation, and insertion of graphic shapes.** WARNING: Compatibility note** This sample is only usable on the Newton 2.1 platform and devices with** this platform. For instance, Apple's eMate 300 and MessagePad 2000.** This sample will not work on Newton 2.0 devices because it uses** APIs that are not present in Newton 2.0.ABOUT FEATURES AND WHERE TO FIND RELEVANT CODE:Persistent Data Using Soups:		¥ Uses protoTXView:Externalize(...) and txview:Internalize(...)	¥ Shows how to store data	¥ Where? The Editor's GetSoupData/SetSoupData methods	Scrolling protoTXView:	"Editor" view's methods:	¥ viewSetupDoneScript - calls our SetupScrollers method	¥ SetupScroller method (our method) -- defines protoUpDownScroller stuff	¥ viewSetupFormScript - calls SetGeometry with arguments appropriate	  for non-paged protoTXViews. See docs for more info. Note that for	  non-paged protoTXViews, the 'height' must be set to kMaxScrollHeight.	¥ GetTextHeight method (our method, to show how to accurately find the	  height of the protoTXView data. For PAGED protoTXView views, you 	  can just use the built-in TotalHeight method to find the height of the	  data currently viewed. See the docs for SetGeometry's isPaged argument.	¥ viewScroll2DScript - the scroll arrows call this	¥ viewUpdateScrollersScript - method of protoTXView. This will be called	  when something happens which may affect the scroll arrow. For instance,	  the "maximum height" or "thumb position" may need to change.ÊThe Font and Size buttons:	¥ Uses protoTXView:ChangeRangeRuns(...)	¥ Uses MakeFontMenu(...)	¥ Shows how to implement standard font/size menus.	¥ Where? TheButtonBar's leftButtons array	The UpperCase button:	¥ Uses protoTXView:Replace(...)	¥ Shows how to implement text manipulation tools.	¥ Where? TheButtonBar's leftButtons array	The Censor button:		¥ Uses protoTXView:Replace(...)	¥ Shows how to insert shapes into protoTXView views.	¥ÊIt replaces selected text with a "no" graphic.	¥ Where? The Editor's Censor method."Fake" recognition in protoTXView:	¥ protoTXView does NOT support handwriting recognition!	¥ To see a limited way to fake simple recognition in protoTXView, see	  the viewWordScript of the editor view.  (We do not recommend	  this technique.  There is no way to implement the write-over correction	  or most of the editing gestures that are required to make	  handwriting recognition useful to the user.)
