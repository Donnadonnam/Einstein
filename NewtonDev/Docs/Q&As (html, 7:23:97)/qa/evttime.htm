After some experimentation, I've discovered that it is not in ticks.  What is this time value?<BR><BR>A:    The time value is actually the number of milliseconds since the Newton device was last reset.  The Newton Programmer's Guide incorrectly states that it is the number of ticks since the unit was last reset.  Note that because the unit of time is milliseconds, you can exceed NewtonScript's integer representation fairly quickly.  <BR><BR>    When you do run out of bits of precision for the millisecond value, the number will wrap to the smallest representable integer in NewtonScript.  According to two's complement binary representation, that number is <CODE>0x3FFFFFFF</CODE>, or <CODE>-536870912</CODE> decimal. Therefore, the time  value will start counting at zero, count up to <CODE>536870911</CODE>, wrap to <CODE>-536870912</CODE> then start to count back up to <CODE>536870911</CODE>.</DL>
