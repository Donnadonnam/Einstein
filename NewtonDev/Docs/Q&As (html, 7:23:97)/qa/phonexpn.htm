Something is going wrong in the <CODE>setup1 </CODE>method.  Is this a known bug?<BR><BR>A:    Yes, this is a known bug.  <CODE>protoPhoneExpando</CODE> (and the entire expando user interface) have been deprecated in the Newton 2.0 OS, and are only supported for backward compatibility.  If possible, you should redesign your application to avoid the expandos.<BR><BR>    The problem seems to be that the expando shell is sending the <CODE>setup1 </CODE>and <CODE>setup2 </CODE>messages to the template in the <CODE>lines </CODE>array.  These methods in <CODE>protoPhoneExpando </CODE>rely on information that isn't created until the view is actually opened.<BR><BR>    We're investigating solutions to this problem.  You can usually hack around the problem by placing a <CODE>labelCommands </CODE>slot in the template which has an array of one element, that element being the label you want to appear in the phone line.  For example: <CODE>labelCommands: ["phone"]</CODE>.<BR><BR>    This hack works only if your <CODE>protoPhoneExpando </CODE>doesn't use the <CODE>phoneIndex </CODE>feature.  If it does, you'll have problems that are harder to work around.</DL>
