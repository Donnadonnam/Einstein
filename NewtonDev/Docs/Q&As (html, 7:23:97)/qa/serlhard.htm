This pin only exists on the eMate 300 and the Newton Serial Adapter.</PRE><BR></CODE><BR>    All inputs are:<BR>        Ri 12K ohms<BR>        minimum Vih 0.2v, Vil -0.2V<BR>        maximum tolerance Vih 15V, Vil -15V<BR><BR>    All outputs are:<BR>        Rl 450 ohms<BR>        minimum Voh 3.6V, Vol -3.6V<BR>        maximum Voh 5.5V, Vol -5.5V<BR><BR>    No more than 40mA total can be drawn from all pins on the serial port. Pins 3 & 6 tri-state when SCC's /RTS is not asserted.<BR><BR>    The EIA RS-422 standard modulates its data signal against an inverted (negative) copy of the same signal on another wire (twisted pairs 3/6 & 5/8 above).  This differential signal is compatable with older RS-232 standards by converting to EIA standard RS-423, which involves grounding the positive side of the RS-422 receiver, and leaving the positive side of the RS-422 transmitter unconnected.  Doing so, however, limits the usable cable distance to approximately 50 feet, and is somewhat less reliable.<BR><BR>    The MessagePad 120 and the MessagePad 130 use a Linear Technology LTC902 serial line driver. This part drives +5/-5 nominally for the RS422 signals, and you can use just one half to interconnect with RS232 compatible signal levels.<BR><BR>    The MessagePad 2000 and the eMate 300 use a Linear Technology LTC1323 serial line driver.
