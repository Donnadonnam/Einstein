You may either open a singlefont from within the application, or else drag a number of fonts ontothe application's icon all at once. Once these tables have beenadded, you will have access to all the glyphs in your fonts,including some you didn't have access to before, when you useapplications that support AAT (e.g. ATSUI applications orQuickDraw&#153; GX applications). For example, since most fontsinclude the "fi" and "fl" ligatures, the AAT Font Tool makes typingthese ligatures as simple as typing the two letters that make up theligature &emdash; so you don't have to remember odd key combinationsany more.</P><P>The AAT Font Tool knows which glyphs are in a font by looking attheir names. These names are contained in a special table in everyTrueType font, called the 'post' table. If you wish, you may specifya name list to the AAT Font Tool for it to use instead of using thenames in the 'post' table.</P><P>You have the option of specifying a list of extra glyphs to beadded to a font (called an "add list"), where each of the glyphs tobe added is made up of other glyphs already in the font. Forinstance, if your font doesn't contain vowels with macron signs overthem, but it does contain both unaccented vowels and a standalonemacron sign, then you can provide an add list telling the AAT FontTool how to synthesize the vowels with macrons, which will then beadded to the font. Once you do this, these glyphs are treated asregular glyphs in the font; in particular, tables added by the AATFont Tool include support for the new glyphs. This means, forinstance, that the Unicode character mapping table information forthe newly added glyphs will be added automatically. For moreinformation, see the <A HREF="AddLists.html">About Add Lists</A>document.</P><P>You also have the option of providing textfiles which representother parts of your font for the AAT Font Tool to "compile" and placeinto the font. For instance, you can provide "Morph Input Files"which allow you to specify the kinds of swashes, ligatures and othertypographic effects you wish your font to have. The AAT Font Tooldoes some of these effects automatically, so you have the option ofsupplementing what it does or replacing it altogether. For moreinformation, see the <A HREF="MIF.html">MIF Tutorial</A>document.</P><P>You also have another option: providing a textfile containing aspecification of exactly how the justification table for the new fontis to be built. For more details, see the <A HREF="JIF.html">JIFTutorial</A> document.</P><H2>How to use the AAT Font Tool</H2><P>The AAT Font Tool adds AAT tables to a font or fonts you specify.The AAT Font Tool cannot work on fonts currently installed in yourFonts folder, so move fonts out of there before working on them.</P><OL>   <LI>Launch the AAT Font Tool application.</LI>      <LI>Examine the "Options" menu to see if there are any options you   might wish to change. Each of the actions the AAT Font Tool does   automatically is checked; uncheck any which you don't wish   done.</LI>      <LI>To specify a name list (which is a plain text file of the   glyph names for the font, one name per line), choose the "Use Name   List&#133;" command and navigate to your name list. A sample name   list for the standard 258 glyph Macintosh Roman fonts is available   if you'd like to see what one looks like.</LI>      <LI>To specify an add list, choose the "Use Add List&#133;"   command and navigate to your add list. There is a standard Roman   add list for your use provided with the AAT Font Tool.</LI>      <LI>To specify a "Morph Input File" to be used as the only   metamorphosis effects for the font, choose the "Replace from Morph   Input..." command and navigate to your MIF.</LI>      <LI>To specify a MIF to be used as supplementary metamorphosis   input for the font, choose the "Append from Morph Input..."   command and navigate to your MIF.</LI>      <LI>To specify a "Justification Input File" to be used to   construct the font's justification table, choose the "Replace from   Just Input..." command and navigate to your JIF.</LI>      <LI>Note that all the above steps happen first; and they remain in   effect for all fonts afterwards, until you change them or quit the   application.</LI>      <LI>Now choose the "Open and Process&#133;" command and choose the   suitcase to be worked on. Remember it can't be in the Fonts   folder!</LI></OL><P>A status window will appear showing you the progress of theoperation. Once it's finished, you have the option of specifyinganother font, or different options or input files, or quitting.</P><P></P></BODY></HTML>
