It provides record, stop and play buttons, as well as a gauge showingthe position within the sound, during playback.Method #3 is the complex one; you handle all the recording details yourself, but on the other hand you can specify lots of options like block size, inputgain, compression type, etc., plus you can use each input block as it comes in.
