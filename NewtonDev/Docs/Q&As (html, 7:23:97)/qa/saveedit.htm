To restore, assign the array from the soup to the <CODE>viewChildren</CODE> slot, either at <CODE>viewSetupFormScript</CODE> or <CODE>viewSetupChildrenScript</CODE> time; or later followed by <CODE>RedoChildren</CODE>.<BR><BR>    You shouldn't try to know "all" the slots in a template in the <CODE>viewChildren</CODE> array. (For example, text has optional slots for fonts and tabs, shapes have optional slots for pen width, and new optional slots may be added in future versions.)  Saving the whole array also allows you to gracefully handle templates in the <CODE>viewChildren</CODE> array that don't have an ink, points, or text slot.  In the future, there may be children that represent other data types.</DL>
