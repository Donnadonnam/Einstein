For the least amount of control, create a slot in your application's base view called <CODE>aboutInfo</CODE>.  Place a frame in that slot with the following slots:<BR><BR>    <CODE><PRE>    {tagLine:  "",        // A tagline for your application version: "",        // The version number for the application copyright: "",    // Copyright information trademarks: "",    // Trademark information}</PRE><BR></CODE><BR>    The information found in this frame will be displayed by the NewtApp framework when the user selects "About" from the Info button's popup.  See the picture below for an example of what the user will see.<BR><BR>    Alternatively, you can create your own About view.  If you do this, create a slot in your application's base view called <CODE>aboutView</CODE> containing a reference to a template for your about view (probably using the NTK <CODE>GetLayout</CODE> function.)   A view will be created from that template and opened when the user selects "About" from the Info button's popup.<BR><BR></DL><CENTER><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="pictures/abotslip.gif" ALT="Q&amp;A Diagram"></CENTER>
