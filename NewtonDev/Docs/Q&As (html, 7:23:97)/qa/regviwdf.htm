I don't get the grip of death alert when using Newton 2.1 OS.  How can I keep the grip of death alert from appearing?<BR><BR>A:    In Newton 2.0 OS, you must <CODE>EnsureInternal</CODE> the second argument to the <CODE>RegisterViewDef</CODE> global function.  The <CODE>RegisterViewDef</CODE> global function was changed in Newton 2.1 OS to automatically <CODE>EnsureInternal</CODE> the second argument. <BR><BR>    Note: <CODE>EnsureInternal</CODE>-ing something that has been <CODE>EnsureInternal</CODE>-ed is a very fast operation so you don't need to worry about checking which platform you are running on.</DL>
