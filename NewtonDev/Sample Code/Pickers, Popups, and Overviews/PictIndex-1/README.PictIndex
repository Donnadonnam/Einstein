Then the old copy and paste into a PICT item in ResEdit. I used the Template editor to find the bounds of the PICT (NOTE, the bounds are Top Left Bottom Right). A little subtraction gives you the bounds of the PICT (20 heigh by 95 wide). Of course doing this means the hiliting on the Square and Triangle do not look nice. So I just expanded the coordinates by 5 pixels in each direction. That is how I got the iconBBox rectangle.NOTE: I could have done a better job in the drawing package and given a nice white border on each side of the larger PICT.Using the protoPictIndex:Updating the text item is easy, just look at the indexClickScript. Getting the initial value in the text item is done from the viewSetupFormScript in the protoPictIndexer, take a look, a nice example of re-use.The strings for the text item are in the protoApp (myBase), look for shapeArray.Maurice SharpPIE/DTS
