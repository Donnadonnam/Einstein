All built-in applications that use paragraph views ignore the control keys during text input, which means that users cannot insert control characters into paragraph views. However, applications such as a terminal emulator can make use of control keys. Note that the control key is not used for command-key combinations.<LI>Pressing the Command key in combination with an alphanumeric key can be used to invoke a system or application-defined command. Commands can also be executed by pressing a combination of Command, Option, and Shift keys along with an alphanumeric key.</UL><A NAME=HEADING165-6></A><H3>Text entry and editing</H3> Users can apply the following keyboard actions during text entry and text editing:<P><UL><LI>Pressing the arrow and tab keys to move between fields.<LI>Pressing the standard Macintosh clipboard key combinations produces the same actions as on the Macintosh: Cmd-X to cut the selection to the clipboard, Cmd-C to copy the selection to the clipboard, and Cmd-V to paste from the clipboard. <LI>Pressing the Cmd-A key combination selects all text in the view.</UL><A NAME=HEADING165-11></A><H3>Slips, windows, and buttons</H3> The key-view is generally the view that contains the caret and receives and processes keyboard commands. A slip is displayed differently when it is the key-view, to indicate to the user that key presses are directed to the slip.<P> <A HREF=#MARKER-9-24>Figure 4-1</A> shows how the find slip looks when it is not the key-view.<P><B>Figure 4-1  <A NAME=MARKER-9-24></A>The find slip when it is not the key view</B><P><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "graphics/FindSlp1.jpg"><BR><BR> <A HREF=#MARKER-9-25>Figure 4-2</A> shows how the Find slip looks when it is the key view.<P><B>Figure 4-2  <A NAME=MARKER-9-25></A>The Find slip when it is the key view</B><P><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "graphics/FindSlp2.jpg"><BR><BR> When a slip is the key-view, its border is thicker, and the default button is marked with lines above and below the button. The user can select the default button by pressing the Return key. These appearance features are only applied when a keyboard is connected. When a keyboard is not connected, the default button looks just like any other button and the slip containing the caret is drawn exactly like other slips.<P> As soon as the user taps to move the caret, the border and the default button change to match the new caret location. Note that since the caret can be placed in a slip that is not the frontmost slip, the key-view slip is not necessarily the same as the frontmost slip.<P> Older applications do not have default buttons. However, the borders of slips drawn in older applications are highlighted as shown above when they contain the caret.<P> The user can close the frontmost window or slip by pressing the Cmd-W key combination, the Cmd-period key combination, or the "Close" key on the eMate 300 keyboard. This does work with older applications. Also note that, unlike other keyboard commands, the close button is applied to the frontmost slip regardless of whether that slip contains the caret.<P><A NAME=HEADING165-23></A><H3><A NAME=MARKER-9-26></A>Menus</H3> This section describes keyboard usage with Newton menus.<P> Application-defined keys or key combinations can be used to display popup menus. Some system-wide standards are defined (such as Cmd-N for New and Cmd-R for the routing menu, among others), but application developers can override these definitions if desired.<P> While a menu is displayed, the user can change the highlighted item by pressing the up-arrow and down-arrow keys. If necessary, the menu will scroll up or down. The right-arrow and left-arrow keys are also supported for menus that contain two-dimensional grids.<P> When a menu is opened by way of a keyboard command, the first item of the menu is initially highlighted. If the menu is opened in some other way, no item is initially highlighted; in this case, the user can highlight the top item by pressing the down-arrow key, or the user can highlight the bottom item by pressing the up-arrow key.<P> Pressing the Return key selects the highlighted item. This is the same as tapping on that item.<P> Pressing a letter or sequence of letters "type-selects" menu items, as in the Macintosh Finder and standard file dialogs. If necessary, the menu scrolls to reveal the type-selected item.<P> Menu items can have keyboard equivalents that are displayed to the right of the item. These are only displayed when a keyboard is actually connected.<P><DL><DT><B>Note</B><DD>Only printable characters are displayed on menus as key equivalents. <EM></EM>  <IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "graphics/diamond.gif"></DL> The key equivalents can be used when the receiving application contains the caret or when the menu is open. <A HREF=#MARKER-9-27>Figure 4-3</A> shows the basic appearance of a menu with and without its keyboard equivalents displayed.<P><B>Figure 4-3  <A NAME=MARKER-9-27></A>A menu with and without its keyboard equivalents displayed</B><P><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "graphics/menukeys.jpg"><BR><BR><DL><DT><B>Note</B><DD>The keyboard equivalents shown in <A HREF=#MARKER-9-27>Figure 4-3</A> are not the actual key-combinations for these commands. <EM></EM>  <IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "graphics/diamond.gif"></DL><A NAME=HEADING165-38></A><H4>The Command-key Combination popup Help Slip</H4> Keyboard equivalents are not displayed for buttons. Instead, the user can display a popup help slip by holding down the command key for approximately 1.5 seconds. The popup help slip displays all of the valid command keys for the current context. <P> The system automatically produces the popup help slip. You register your application's command-key combinations, as described in <A HREF=NPG2-175.html#MARKER-9-38>&quot;The Command-Key Mapping Frame&quot;</A>, and the system constructs the help slip based on which command keys are available.<P> The popup help slip displays the available commands ordered alphabetically by category. Your application can add to the standard categories or can define new categories, as described in <A HREF=NPG2-169.html#MARKER-9-31>&quot;Handling Command Keys&quot;</A>.<P> <A HREF=#MARKER-9-28>Figure 4-4</A> shows a version of the command-key combination popup slip.<P><B>Figure 4-4  <A NAME=MARKER-9-28></A>Command-key combination slip</B><P><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "graphics/helpslip.jpg"><BR><BR> The popup help slip does not display function key equivalents, which are permanently labeled on the eMate 300 keyboard. <P> The popup help slip closes automatically when the user releases the command key, or when the user presses any key on the keyboard. <P> If the number of commands defined exceeds the maximum number that can be displayed at once, the system adds a scroller to the popup help slip. The user can scroll the view with the up-arrow and down-arrow keys (while holding down the command key), or by tapping on the scroller's buttons. The user must continue to press the command key while scrolling the view.<P> If a command lacks a name, the command does not appear in the popup help slip. This is true of the standard command-arrow combinations for navigation. If a key-combination command has no category, but does have a name, it is automatically placed in the "Other" category.<P> Applications can completely override this slip by providing a different help slip, or can use the information presented in the default slip in their own way, as described in <A HREF=NPG2-169.html#MARKER-9-31>&quot;Handling Command Keys&quot;</A>.<P><A NAME=HEADING165-50></A><H3>System and Built-in App Command Key Assignments</H3> This section describes the command-key combinations for system-level and built-in application operations. <A HREF=#MARKER-9-5>Table 4-2</A> shows the system-level command-key combinations.<p><B>Table 4-2  <A NAME=MARKER-9-5></A>System-level key assignments </B><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING=3><TH ALIGN=LEFT>Command-key combination <TH>Behavior<TR><TD>Cmd-A <TD>Selects all text in a note or the current view <TR><TD>Cmd-C <TD>Copies selected text to clipboard<TR><TD>Cmd-E<TD>Opens the title slip<TR><TD>Cmd-F<TD>Opens the Find slip<TR><TD>Cmd-N<TD>Opens the New button picker<TR><TD>Cmd-O <TD>Opens the overview, toggles to close overview<TR><TD>Cmd-P<TD>Opens the print slip<TR><TD>Cmd-R<TD>Opens the Routing button picker, with first item hilited<TR><TD>Cmd-S<TD>Opens the Show button picker<TR><TD>Cmd-V<TD>Pastes selected text at cursor<TR><TD>Cmd-W<TD>Closes the open window/slip    <TR><TD>Cmd-X <TD>Cuts selected text<TR><TD>Cmd-Z<TD>Undo/redo<TR><TD>Cmd-return<TD>Opens popup<TR><TD>Cmd-` (tilde)<TD>Opens assist<TR><TD>Cmd-.
